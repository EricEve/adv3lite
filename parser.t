/*
 *   Parser is the class that implements the main parsing procedure, namely
 *   taking a line of text from the player, figuring out what it means, and
 *   executing it.
 *   
 *   The conventional IF parsing loop simply consists of reading a line of
 *   text from the player, calling Parser.parse() on the string, and
 *   repeating.
 *   
 *   In most cases you'll just need a single Parser instance.  The Parser
 *   object keeps track of unfinished commands, such as when we need to ask
 *   for disambiguation help or for a missing object.  If for some reason
 *   you want to keep multiple sets of this kind of state (reading input
 *   from more than one player, for example), you can create as many Parser
 *   instances as needed.

     *   Auto-Look: Should we treat an empty command line (i.e., the user
     *   just presses Return) as a LOOK AROUND command?
     *   
     *   The traditional handling since the Infocom era has always been to
     *   treat an empty command line as a parsing error, and display an
     *   error message along the lines of "I beg your pardon?".  Given that
     *   an empty command line has no conflicting meaning, though, we
     *   *could* assign it a meaning.
     *   
     *   But what meaning should that be?  A blank line is the simplest
     *   possible command for a player to enter, so it would make sense to
     *   define it as some very commonly used command.  It's also fairly
     *   easy to enter a blank line accidentally (which is partly why the
     *   traditional reply is an error message), so the command should be
     *   benign - it shouldn't be a problem to enter it unintentionally.
     *   It can't be anything with parallel verbs, like NORTH, since then
     *   there'd be no good reason to pick NORTH instead of, say, SOUTH.
     *   Finally, it has to be intransitive, since it obviously won't
     *   involve an object name.  The obvious candidates that fit all of
     *   these criteria are LOOK and INVENTORY.  LOOK is probably the more
     *   useful and the more frequently used of the two, so it's the one we
     *   choose by default.
     *   
     *   If this property is set to true, we'll perform a LOOK AROUND
     *   command when the player enters a blank command line.  If nil,
     *   we'll show an error message.

     *   objects, it's EXAMINE.  For locations, it's GO TO.

     *   to see if we can come up with a working command.
     *   
     *   Our spelling correction algorithm is designed to be quite
     *   conservative.  In particular, we generally limit candidates for
     *   "correct" words to the vocabulary for objects that are actually in
     *   scope, which avoids revealing the existence of objects that

     *   and more importantly avoids giving away information that the
     *   player shouldn't know yet.
     *   
     *   We set this to true by default, in an attempt to reduce the
     *   player's typing workload by automatically correcting simple typos
     *   when possible.  If for some reason the spelling corrector is

     *   message such as "I don't know the word <foo>."  If this property
     *   is nil, the parser will instead simply say that it doesn't
     *   recognize the syntax, or that the object in question isn't
     *   present, without saying specifically which word wasn't recognized,
     *   or indeed even admitting that there was such a thing.
     *   
     *   There are two schools of thought on this, both concerned with
     *   optimizing the user experience.
     *   
     *   The first school holds that the parser's job is to be as helpful
     *   as possible.  First and foremost, that means we should understand
     *   the user's input as often as possible.  But when we can't, it
     *   means that we should be do our best to explain what we didn't
     *   understand, to help the user formulate a working command next
     *   time.  In the case of a word the parser doesn't recognize, we can
     *   be pretty sure that the unknown word is the reason we can't
     *   understand the input.  The best way to help the user correct the
     *   problem is to let them know exactly which word we didn't know,
     *   rather than make them guess at what we didn't understand.  This is
     *   the way the classic Infocom games worked, and it's the traditional
     *   TADS default as well.
     *   
     *   The second school holds that the user's overriding interest is
     *   maintaining suspension of disbelief, and that the parser should do
     *   its best not to interfere with that.  A major aspect of this in IF
     *   the illusion that the game world is as boundless as the real
     *   world.  Missing dictionary words tend to break this illusion: if
     *   the user types EXAMINE ZEBRA, and the parser replies that it
     *   doesn't know the word "zebra", we've suddenly exposed a limit of
     *   the game world.  If we instead play coy and simply say that
     *   there's no zebra currently present, we allow the player to imagine
     *   that a zebra might yet turn up.  This is the way Inform games
     *   typically work.
     *   
     *   Each approach has its advantages and disadvantages, adherents and
     *   detractors, and it seems that neither one is objectively "right".
     *   It comes down to taste.  But there seems to be a clear preference
     *   among the majority of players in the modern era for the second
     *   approach.  The key factor is probably that typical IF commands are
     *   so short that it's easy enough to spot a typo without help from
     *   the parser, so the clarity benefits of "unknown word" messages
     *   seem considerably outweighed by the harm they do to the illusion
     *   of boundlessness.  So, our default is the second option, playing
     *   coy.

     *   about, we have a disagreement with the player's apparent
     *   expectations and must ask for clarification.

     *   2.  Indefinite mode: TAKE A BOOK, TAKE ANY BOOK, TAKE TWO BOOKS.
     *   The goal is to choose the given number of objects from the
     *   possible matches, arbitrarily choosing from the available objects.

 *   CommandProduction is a special Production subclass for the top-level
 *   grammar rule for the overall command. 
 *   
 *   Each instance of this type of production must define the following
 *   '->' properties in its syntax template:
 *   
 *   actor_ is the noun phrase giving the addressee of the command, if any.
 *   A command such as TELL ACTOR TO DO X or (using the long-standing IF
 *   convention) ACTOR, DO X addresses a command to an actor; i.e., it
 *   tells the actor to carry out the command, rather than the player's
 *   avatar.  A command that isn't addressed to an actor can leave actor_
 *   as nil.  
 *   
 *   cmd_ is the *first* predicate phrase (see below), in the desired order
 *   of execution.  For example, for "open the door and go north", cmd_
 *   should be set to the match tree for the "open the door" predicate.
 *   
 *   conj_ is any conjunction or punctuation ending the first predicate
 *   phrase.  This might be a period at the end of the sentence, or a word
 *   like 'and' or 'then' that can separate multiple commands.  This can be
 *   nil if there's no conjunction at all (such as when the whole command
 *   is just the first predicate).  The reason we need conj_ is that it
 *   tells us where any subsequent command on the same command line starts.
 *   If cmd2_ is not nil, we'll ignore conj_ and use cmd2_ instead for this
 *   purpose.
 *   
 *   cmd2_ is optional: it's the *second* predicate phrase.  If this is not
 *   nil, it tells the parser where to start parsing the next predicate on
 *   the same command line after finishing with the first one.  This is
 *   optional, even if the command line really does have more than one
 *   predicate, because the parser can use conj_ instead to infer where the
 *   second predicate must start.
 *   
 *   (It's probably intuitively obvious what "first predicate" means, but
 *   for the sake of translators, here's a more thorough analysis.  Some
 *   command productions can match more than one predicate phrase, but this
 *   is only for the sake of determining where the first one ends,
 *   syntactically.  The execution engine actually only carries out the
 *   first predicate matched for a given parse tree - it simply ignores any
 *   others in the same tree.  After we finish executing the first
 *   predicate from the match, we go back and re-parse the remaining text
 *   from scratch, as raw text; at that point, the next predicate in the
 *   text becomes the first predicate in the new parse tree and gets
 *   executed.  We repeat this until we run out of text.  So we do
 *   eventually execute everything the player types in - but not on the
 *   first parse; we have to do one parse per predicate.  We have to repeat
 *   the parsing because carrying out the first action could change the
 *   game state in such a way that we'll find a different match to the next
 *   predicate than we would have if we'd parsed everything up front.  By
 *   "first predicate phrase", then, we mean the one that gets executed
 *   first.  The point is to carry out the user's wishes as expressed in
 *   the command, so we want the first predicate we execute to be the one
 *   that the player *intends* to be carried out first; so by "first" we
 *   really mean the one that a speaker of the natural language would
 *   expect to be performed first, given the structure of the sentence and
 *   the rules of the language.  In English, this is easy: X THEN Y or X,Y
 *   or X AND Y all mean "first do X, then do Y" - the reading order is the
 *   same as the execution order.)

/*
 *   A NounRole is a internal parser object that provides information on a
 *   given noun role in a predicate.
 *   
 *   A noun role is one of the standard semantic roles that a noun phrase
 *   can play in a natural language predicate.  A predicate is a
 *   combination of an action and the objects that it applies to.  Any
 *   given verb has a set of assigned roles that need to be filled to make
 *   a complete thought.  (Sometimes the same verb word has multiple senses
 *   with different numbers of slots to fill, but you can think of the
 *   different senses as actually being different actions at some abstract
 *   level, which all happen to share the same verb word.)  For example,
 *   TAKE requires a noun phrase telling us which object is to be taken;
 *   this is called the direct object of the verb.  PUT X IN Y has a direct
 *   object (the thing to be put somewhere) and an indirect object (the
 *   place to put it).
 *   
 *   Natural languages use a fairly small number of these noun roles.  Most
 *   predicates in most languages have just one role: TAKE, DROP, OPEN,
 *   CLOSE.  We call this first-and-only noun role the direct object.  A
 *   few predicates have two roles: PUT IN, GIVE TO, UNLOCK WITH.  We call
 *   the second role the indirect object.  A very few predicates have three
 *   roles: TRADE BOB AN APPLE FOR AN ORANGE, PUT PLUTONIUM IN REACTOR WITH
 *   TONGS.  We call the third role the "accessory" object (which is
 *   something we made up - there doesn't seem to be an agreed-upon word
 *   among linguists for this role).  And it appears that there's simply no
 *   such thing as a "tetratransitive" verb in any natural human language,
 *   so we don't bother defining a fourth slot.
 *   
 *   (It would be easy for a game to add an object defining a fourth slot,
 *   analogous with these others, and use it to include a fourth noun
 *   phrase in the grammar for applicable verbs.  The rest of the parser
 *   will pick it up automatically if you do.  However, the practical
 *   utility of this seems minimal.  *Three*-noun verbs are incredibly rare
 *   in IF, in part because situations requiring them are rare, and in part
 *   because they're almost guaranteed to vex players and be panned as
 *   guess-the-syntax puzzles.  One can only imagine how a *four*-noun

/*
 *   VerbProduction is a special Production subclass for verb (predicate)
 *   rules.  This production has special processing for building out the
 *   object phrases making up the verb.
 *   
 *   Each instance should have an 'action' property giving the Action
 *   object associated with the verb rule.  This is the Action that will be
 *   performed when the parser matches the command input to the rule.
 *   
 *   Some languages, such as English, have "positional" predicate grammars.
 *   This means that the position of a noun phrase in the sentence
 *   determines its role (direct object, indirect object, etc).  In the
 *   grammar for a positional language, each predicate rule simply needs to
 *   plug in a singleNoun or nounList production (as appropriate) in each
 *   noun phrase position, with its '->' property set to correspond to the
 *   role: ->dobjMatch for a direct object, ->iobjMatch for an indirect
 *   object, and ->accMatch for an accessory object.
 *   
 *   Some languages, such as German and Latin, identify the role of a noun
 *   phrase using grammatical case.  This means that the articles change
 *   form in the different roles, or that the nouns themselves are
 *   inflected (they have different forms, such as added suffixes)
 *   according to role.  Case languages tend to have flexible predicate
 *   word order, because the case markers tell you the role of each noun
 *   even if the nouns are rearranged.  For this reason, it can be tedious
 *   to write a grammar for a case language the way we do for English,
 *   where the word ordering for a given verb is so rigid that we can
 *   easily just write out each possible phrasing manually.  For a case
 *   language, you'll probably instead want to write a set of generic verb
 *   rules that cover *all* verbs (i.e., you leave the verb word itself as
 *   a sub-production) in all of the different word orders, and use the
 *   case tagging in the language to determine the role of each noun
 *   phrase.  For this style of grammar, the grammar must set the property
 *   nounPhraseRole in the top-level rule for each noun phrase case; set
 *   this to DirectObject, IndirectObject, AccessoryObject, etc., according
 *   to the role denoted by the case.
 *   
 *   Still other languages, such as Japanese, use particles (grammar
 *   function words) to denote the role of each noun phrase in the
 *   sentence.  This is similar to grammatical case, but the role
 *   information is encoded in separate words (the particles) rather than
 *   in noun affixes, so the nouns themselves aren't inflected.  You can
 *   handle this type of language roughly the same way you'd handle a case
 *   language.  Create generic rules that cover all verbs, then create a
 *   grammar rule for each particle-plus-noun structure.  In each
 *   particle-plus-noun phrase's top-level rule, set the nounPhraseRole
 *   property to the appropriate role object (DirectObject, etc).

/*
 *   Base class for pronouns.  We represent each type of pronoun with an
 *   object, to abstract pronouns away from the vocabulary.
 *   
 *   The base library defines a set of pronouns that are common to most
 *   languages: It, Him, Her, Them, You, Y'all, Me, and Us, plus reflexive
 *   forms of It, Him, Her, and Them.  Some languages might not employ all
 *   of these (French, for example, has no neuter gender, so there's no
 *   equivalent of It), and some might need additional pronouns (e.g.,
 *   French needs a feminine third-person plural).  If a pronoun we define
 *   here has no equivalent in a given language, the language module should
 *   simply omit any grammar mentioning it.  If the language has pronouns
 *   that aren't in the basic set, the language module can provide
 *   definitions for its own additional Pronoun objects, along with the
 *   corresponding grammar rules.
 *   
 *   The library itself only directly references one pronoun object: You.
 *   The parser specifically references this pronoun because it binds to
 *   the addressee of a command, which has a special role in the parsing
 *   process.  Apart from You, though, the library's use of pronouns is
 *   directed by the grammar: if a given Pronoun doesn't appear in the
 *   grammar anywhere, the library will never use it.  (Other than in
 *   iterations over Pronoun instances, anyway; but these will be harmless
 *   because the parser is just trying to be inclusive.)  This means that
 *   language modules are free to ignore pronouns (other than You) from the
 *   standard set when they're not a good match for the language's needs.
 *   For example, if you need distinct Animate and Inanimate forms of Him
 *   and Her, you could simply define four new Pronoun objects for these
 *   forms, and use them in place of Him and Her throughout your grammar.  
 *   
 *   Note that these objects are NOT grammar rules or dictionary words.
 *   These are abstract objects representing the "binding" of the pronouns
 *   - basically the set of grammatical attributes (gender, number) that
 *   determine whether a given noun phrase is a valid antecedent for a
 *   given pronoun.  That's why we don't define separate Pronoun objects
