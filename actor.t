/*
 *   An "agenda item."  Each actor can have its own "agenda," which is a
 *   list of these items.  Each item represents an action that the actor
 *   wants to perform - this is usually a goal the actor wants to achieve,
 *   or a conversational topic the actor wants to pursue.
 *   
 *   On any given turn, an actor can carry out only one agenda item.
 *   
 *   Agenda items are a convenient way of controlling complex behavior.
 *   Each agenda item defines its own condition for when the actor can
 *   pursue the item, and each item defines what the actor does when
 *   pursuing the item.  Agenda items can improve the code structure for an
 *   NPC's behavior, since they nicely isolate a single background action
 *   and group it with the conditions that trigger it.  But the main
 *   benefit of agenda items is the one-per-turn pacing - by executing at
 *   most one agenda item per turn, we ensure that the NPC will carry out
 *   its self-initiated actions at a measured pace, rather than as a jumble
 *   of random actions on a single turn.
 *   
 *   Note that NPC-initiated conversation messages override agendas.  If an
 *   actor has an active ConvNode, AND the ConvNode displays a
 *   "continuation message" on a given turn, then the actor will not pursue
 *   its agenda on that turn.  In this way, ConvNode continuation messages
 *   act rather like high-priority agenda items.
