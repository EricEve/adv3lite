     *   Remember that our time-keeping scheme is a sort of "Schrodinger's
     *   clock" [see footnote 1].  Between time checks, the game time
     *   clock is in a vague, fuzzy state, drifting along at an

     *   question we're being asked ("what time is it?").  As in quantum
     *   mechanics, then, the act of observation affects the quantity
     *   being observed.  Therefore, you should avoid calling this routine
     *   unnecessarily; call it only when you actually have to tell the
     *   player what time it is - and don't tell the player what time it
     *   is unless they ask, or there's some other good reason.
     *   
     *   If you want a string-formatted version of the time (as in

     *   2 for the second, and so on.
     *   
     *   The format string consists of one or more prefixes, followed by a
     *   format mask.  The prefixes are flags that control the formatting,
     *   but don't directly insert any text into the result string:
     *   
     *   24 -> use 24-hour time; if this isn't specified, a 12-hour clock
     *   is used instead.  On the 24-hour clock, midnight is hour zero, so
     *   12:10 AM is represented as 00:10.
     *   
     *   [am][pm] -> use 'am' as the AM string, and 'pm' as the PM string,
     *   for the 'a' format mask character.  This lets you specify an
     *   arbitrary formatting for the am/pm marker, overriding the default
     *   of 'am' or 'pm'.  For example, if you want to use 'A.M.' and
     *   'P.M.'  as the markers, you'd write a prefix of [A.M.][P.M.].  If
     *   you want to use ']' within the marker string itself, quote it with
     *   a '%': '[[AM%]][PM%]]' indicates markers of '[AM]' and '[PM]'.
     *   
     *   Following the prefix flags, you specify the format mask.  This is
     *   a set of special characters that specify parts of the time to
     *   insert.  Each special character is replaced with the corresponding
     *   formatted time information in the result string.  Any character
     *   that isn't special is just copied to the result string as is.  The
     *   special character are:
     *   
     *   h -> hour, no leading zero for single digits (hence 9:05, for
     *   example)
     *   
     *   hh -> hour, leading zero (09:05)
     *   
     *   m -> minutes, no leading zero (9:5)
     *   
     *   mm -> minutes with a leading zero (9:05)
     *   
     *   a -> AM/PM marker.  If an [am][pm] prefix was specified, the 'am'
     *   or 'pm' string from the prefix is used.  Otherwise, 'am' or 'pm'
     *   is literally inserted.
     *   
     *   % -> quote next character (so %% -> a single %)
     *   
     *   other -> literal
     *   
     *   Examples:
     *   
     *   'hh:mma' produces '09:05am'
     *.  '[A.M][P.M]h:mma' produces '9:05 P.M.'

/*
 *   [Footnote 1]
 *   
 *   "Schrodinger's cat" is a famous thought experiment in quantum
 *   physics, concerning how a quantum mechanical system exists in
 *   multiple, mutually exclusive quantum states simultaneously until an
 *   observer forces the system to assume only one of the states by the
 *   act of observation.  The thought experiment has been popularized as
 *   an illustration of how weird and wacky QM is, but it's interesting to
 *   note that Schrodinger actually devised it to expose what he saw as an
 *   unacceptable paradox in quantum theory.
 *   
 *   The thought experiment goes like this: a cat is locked inside a
 *   special box that's impervious to light, X-rays, etc., so that no one
 *   on the outside can see what's going on inside.  The box contains,
 *   apart from the cat, a little radiation source and a radiation
 *   counter.  When the counter detects a certain radioactive emission, it
 *   releases some poison gas, killing the cat.  The radioactive emission
 *   is an inherently quantum mechanical, unpredictable process, and as
 *   such can (and must) be in a superposition of "emitted" and "not
 *   emitted" states until observed.  Because the whole system is
 *   unobservable from the outside, the supposition is that everything
 *   inside is "entangled" with the quantum state of the radioactive
 *   emission, hence the cat is simultaneously living and dead until
 *   someone opens the box and checks.  It's not just that no one knows;
 *   rather, the cat is actually and literally alive and dead at the same
 *   time.
 *   
 *   Schrodinger's point was that this superposition of the cat's states
 *   is a necessary consequence of the way QM was interpreted at the time
 *   he devised the experiment, but that it's manifestly untrue, since we
 *   know that cats are macroscopic objects that behave according to
 *   classical, deterministic physics.  Hence a paradox, hence the
 *   interpretation of the theory must be wrong.  The predominant
 *   interpretation of QM has since shifted a bit so that the cat would
 *   now count as an observer - not because it's alive or conscious or
 *   anything metaphysical, but simply because it's macroscopic - so the
 *   cat's fate is never actually entangled with the radioactive source's
 *   quantum state.  Popular science writers have continued to talk about
 *   Schrodinger's cat as though it's for real, maybe to make QM seem more
 *   exotic to laypersons, but most physicists today wouldn't consider the
 *   experiment to be possible as literally stated.  Physicists today
 *   might think of it as a valid metaphor to decribe systems where all of
 *   the components are on an atomic or subatomic scale, but no one today
 *   seriously thinks you can create an actual cat that's simultaneously
 *   alive and dead.
