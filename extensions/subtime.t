     *   in a vague, fuzzy state, drifting along at an indeterminate pace from

     *   manager is forced to commit to a particular time, because we have to
     *   give a specific answer to the question we're being asked ("what time is
     *   it?").  As in quantum mechanics, then, the act of observation affects
     *   the quantity being observed.  Therefore, you should avoid calling this
     *   routine unnecessarily; call it only when you actually have to tell the
     *   player what time it is - and don't tell the player what time it is
     *   unless they ask, or there's some other good reason.
     *
     *   If you want a string-formatted version of the time (as in '9:05pm'),

 *   [Footnote 1]
 *   
 *   "Schrodinger's cat" is a famous thought experiment in quantum
 *   physics, concerning how a quantum mechanical system exists in
 *   multiple, mutually exclusive quantum states simultaneously until an
 *   observer forces the system to assume only one of the states by the
 *   act of observation.  The thought experiment has been popularized as
 *   an illustration of how weird and wacky QM is, but it's interesting to
 *   note that Schrodinger actually devised it to expose what he saw as an
 *   unacceptable paradox in quantum theory.
 *   
 *   The thought experiment goes like this: a cat is locked inside a
 *   special box that's impervious to light, X-rays, etc., so that no one
 *   on the outside can see what's going on inside.  The box contains,
 *   apart from the cat, a little radiation source and a radiation
 *   counter.  When the counter detects a certain radioactive emission, it
 *   releases some poison gas, killing the cat.  The radioactive emission
 *   is an inherently quantum mechanical, unpredictable process, and as
 *   such can (and must) be in a superposition of "emitted" and "not
 *   emitted" states until observed.  Because the whole system is
 *   unobservable from the outside, the supposition is that everything
 *   inside is "entangled" with the quantum state of the radioactive
 *   emission, hence the cat is simultaneously living and dead until
 *   someone opens the box and checks.  It's not just that no one knows;
 *   rather, the cat is actually and literally alive and dead at the same
 *   time.
 *   
 *   Schrodinger's point was that this superposition of the cat's states
 *   is a necessary consequence of the way QM was interpreted at the time
 *   he devised the experiment, but that it's manifestly untrue, since we
 *   know that cats are macroscopic objects that behave according to
 *   classical, deterministic physics.  Hence a paradox, hence the
 *   interpretation of the theory must be wrong.  The predominant
 *   interpretation of QM has since shifted a bit so that the cat would
 *   now count as an observer - not because it's alive or conscious or
 *   anything metaphysical, but simply because it's macroscopic - so the
 *   cat's fate is never actually entangled with the radioactive source's
 *   quantum state.  Popular science writers have continued to talk about
 *   Schrodinger's cat as though it's for real, maybe to make QM seem more
 *   exotic to laypersons, but most physicists today wouldn't consider the
 *   experiment to be possible as literally stated.  Physicists today
 *   might think of it as a valid metaphor to decribe systems where all of
 *   the components are on an atomic or subatomic scale, but no one today
 *   seriously thinks you can create an actual cat that's simultaneously
 *   alive and dead.
