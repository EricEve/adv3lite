<h1>Subtime</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>"Subjective Time" module.  This implements a form of in-game
 time-keeping that attempts to mimic the player's subjective
 experience of time passing in the scenario while still allowing for
 occasional, reasonably precise time readings, such as from a
 wristwatch in the game world.</p>
 
<p>Both the subtime module and most of the text of this page of documentation are the work of Michael J. Roberts.</p>

<h2>New Classes, Objects and Properties</h2>

<p>In addition to a number of properties intended purely for internal use, this extension defines the following new classes, objects and properties:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Classes</em>: <strong>ClockEvent</strong>.</li>
<li><em>Objects</em>: <strong>clockManager</strong>.</li>
<li><em>Properties/methods on clockManager</em>: <span class="code">checkTime()</span>, <span class="code">baseScaleFactor</span>, <span class="code">scaleFactor</span>, <span class="code">checkTimeFmt(fmt)</span>, <span class="code">formatTime(t, fmt)</span>, <span class="code">eventReached(evt)</span>, <span class="code">baseDate</span>.</li>
<li><em>Properties/methods on ClockEvent</em>: <span class="code">eventTime</span>, <span class="code">formatTime(fmt)</span>, <span class="code">eventReached()</span>, <span class="code">reachedWhen</span>, <span class="code">scaleFactor</span>, <span class="code">turnsToEvent</span>.</li>
</ul>

<a name="usage"></a>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>Include the subtime.t file after the library files but before your game source files.</p>

<p>Create a number of <span class="code">ClockEvent</span> objects in your game, each representing an event that occurs at a particular time. The Clock Manager automatically builds
a list of all of these objects during pre-initialization, so you don't
have to explicitly tell the clock manager about these.   
Whenever the story reaches one of these events, you should call the
<span class="code">eventReached()</span> method of the event object.  This will set the clock
time to the event's current time, and take note of how long we have until the next plot event.
Alternatively, you can define the ClockEvent's <span class="code">reachedWhen</span> property as a condition that becomes true (or a method that returns true) when this ClockEvent is reached. For this to work, the events.t module must be present in the game. If several ClockEvents have <span class="code">reachedWhen</span> conditions that become true on the same turn, only the first one (i.e. the one with the earliest <span class="code">eventTime</span>) will be reached on that turn (the next one will be reached on the next turn, and so on).</p>

<p>To create a <span class="code">ClockEvent</span> object you need to give it a programmatic name and define its <span class="code">eventTime</span> property. The eventTime property specifies the time at which this event occurs.  This is expressed as a list
with three elements: the day number, the hour (on a 24-hour
clock), and the minute.  The day number is relative to the start
of the game &mdash; day 1 is the first day of the game.  So, for
example, to express 2:40pm on the second day of the game, you'd
write [2,14,40].  Note that 12 AM is written as 0 (zero) on a
24-hour clock, so 12:05am on day 1 would be [1,0,5].</p>

<p>Thus, for example, to specify that when the player character first meets Bob the time is 2:40pm on the second day of the4 game you might define:</p>

 <p><div class="code"><pre>
meetBobEvent: ClockEvent
    eventTime = [2, 14, 10]
;
 </pre></div>
 
<p>Or, by taking advantage of the ClockEvent template defined in advlite.h you could abbreviate this to:</p> 

<p><div class="code"><pre>
meetBobEvent: ClockEvent [2, 14, 10];
 </pre></div>

<p>Either way, when the player character first meets Bob you would then call:</p> 

 <p><div class="code"><pre>
   meetBobEvent.eventReached();
 </pre></div>

<p>Then, when you want to get the current time at any point in the game (when the player character looks at a clock, for example), you would call <span class="code">clockManager.checkTime()</span>.  This returns a list in the same format as <span class="code">ClockEvent.eventTime</span>: [day,hour,minute]. Remember that between time checks, the game time
     clock is in a vague, fuzzy state, drifting along at an
     indeterminate pace from the most recent check.  When this method
     is called, though, the clock manager is forced to commit to a
     particular time, because we have to give a specific answer to the
     question we're being asked ("what time is it?").  Therefore, you should avoid calling this routine
     unnecessarily; call it only when you actually have to tell the
     player what time it is - and don't tell the player what time it
     is unless they ask, or there's some other good reason.</p>
     
<p>You must create at least one ClockEvent in your game, or this module will cause a run-time error. You should in any case create a ClockEvent to set the time at the start of play. This will be the ClockEvent with the earliest eventTime; the earliest ClockEvent is automatically marked as reached at the start of the game; you don't need to call its <span class="code">eventReached()</span> method or set its <span class="code">reachedWhen</span> property.</p>     

<p>If you want your game to start on a particular day (that is, it's important to track the date as well at the time), you can set the starting date (i.e. the date that counts as Day 1) by overriding the clockManager's <strong>baseDate</strong> property to a Date object; for example to start the game on August 24th 2015 you might write:</p>
     
 <p><div class="code"><pre>
 modify clockManager
    baseDate = static new Date(2015, 8, 24)
 ;
 </pre></div>     
  
<p>If <strong>gameMain.gameStartTime</strong> is defined, the date defined there will be used as the starting date instead. If the starting date is not defined in either place, the game will notionally start on January 1st, 2000.</p>  
     
<p>The <span class="code">clockManager</span> works by advancing the notional time by 60 minutes per hundred turns (by default) until half the time until the next ClockEvent is reached. The passage of time per turn is then progressively slowed down to prevent the time of the next ClockEvent being reached prematurely. Note that time is only computed when <span class="code">clockManager.checkTime()</span> is called (either directly or via <span class="code">clockManager.checkTimeFmt(fmt)</span>).</p>

<p>If the notional rate of 60 minutes per 100 turns doesn't suit the pace of your game there are various ways in which you can change it. To change it globally for the entire game you can override the <strong>baseScaleFactor</strong> of <span class="code">clockManager</span> to some other number of minutes per hundred turns, or else override the <strong>scaleFactor</strong> property of the <span class="code">clockManager</span> for the number of minutes per hundred turns to use once the last ClockEvent is passed. For finer-grained control you can override either the <strong>scaleFactor</strong> or the <strong>turnsToEvent</strong> property of one or more ClockEvents. The ClockEvent's <strong>scaleFactor</strong> determines the <span class="code">baseScaleFactor</span> the clockManager will use when the game is between the previous event and this ClockEvent. Alternatively, you can get the game to calculate a suitable <span class="code">scaleFactor</span> for you by defining the ClockEvent's <span class="code">turnsToEvent</span> property. This can be set to an estimate of the number of turns you expect a typical player  to take to get from the previous ClockEvent to this one; the <span class="code">scaleFactor</span> will then be calculated accordingly (on the basis of the estimated number of turns and the number of minutes between the two ClockEvents). It may well be difficult to estimate the number of turns a "typical" player will take, but given the way the clockManager works, it's probably better to underestimate than to overestimate this number.</p>     
     
<a name="format"></a>
<h3>Formatting the Time</h2>     
<p>If you want a string-formatted version of the time (as in '9:05pm'), you can call <span class="code">clockManager.checkTimeFmt(<em>fmt</em>)</span>, where <em>fmt</em> is a string specifying how you want the time to appear. Note that this method does not display anything; rather it returns a single-quoted string containing the current game time formatted in the way specified by <em>fmt</em>.</p>   

<p>For a full list of possible format strings, consult the chapter on the Date intrinsic class in the TADS 3 System Manual. A few of the more convenient ones are listed below:</p>

<ul>
<li><span class="code">%r</span> 	the full 12-hour clock time, e.g. '3:30:00 PM'</li>
<li><span class="code">%R</span> 	the 24-hour clock time with minutes, e.g. '15:30'</li>
<li><span class="code">%T</span> 	the 24-hour clock time with seconds, e.g. '15:30:00' </li>
<li><span class="code">%X</span> 	the preferred time representation according to the locale settings; e.g. '15:30:00'</li>

<li><span class="code">%c</span> 	the preferred date and time stamp for the locale, e.g.'Sun Jun 22 15:30:00 2014'</li>
<li><span class="code">%D</span> 	the short date (in American format), e.g. to '06/22/14'</li>
<li><span class="code">%d/%m/%y</span> the short date (in European format), e.g. '22/06/14'</li>
<li><span class="code">%d-%b-%y</span> the short date in dd-mmm-yy format, e,g, '22-Jun-14' (probably the best format to use to avoid USA/Europe ambiguity)</li>
<li><span class="code">%Y</span> the four-digit year number, e.g. 2014; use in place of <span class="code">%y</span> in any of the above when a four-digit year is required.</li>
<li><span class="code">%I:%M %P</span> the 12-hour clock time with minutes, e.g. '03:30 PM'</li>
<li><span class="code">%a </span>	the abbreviated weekday name ('Mon')</li>
<li><span class="code">%A</span> 	the full weekday name ('Monday') </li>
</ul>

<p>Note that these can be combined as needed, for example <span class="code">timeManager.formatDate('%A, %d-%b-%y %I:%M %P')</span> might return the string 'Sunday, 22-Jun-14 03:30 PM', and of course this method may be used wherever you like in your game code, not just in the status line.</p>

<a name="rationale"></a>     
<h2>Rationale</h2>
 
 
 <p> It's always been difficult to handle the passage of time in
 interactive fiction.  It's such a vexing problem that most IF avoids
 the problem entirely by setting the game action in a world that
 forgot time, where there are no working clocks and where night never
 falls.  Like so many of the hard parts of interactive fiction, the
 difficulty here comes from the uneasy union of simulation and
 narrative that's at the heart of all IF.</p>
    
 <p>In ordinary static narratives, the passage of time can swing between
 extremes: a scene that only takes moments of real-time within the
 story, such as an intense action scene or an extended inner
 monologue, can go on for many pages; and elsewhere in the same story,
 days and years can pass in the space of a sentence or two.  Narrative
 time has no relationship to the length of a passage of text;
 narrative time is related only to the density of story-significant
 action.</p>
   
 <p>It might seem at first glance that this break between in-story time
 and chapter length is a special privilege of the staticness of a
 book: the text just sits there on a page, unchanging in time, so of
 course there's no real-time anchor for the story's internal clock.
 But that can't be it, because we see exactly the same narrative
 manipulation of time in film, which is a fundamentally time-based
 medium.  Films don't present their action in real-time any more than
 books do.  What's more, film follows the same rules as text-based
 fiction in compressing and expanding story-time: many minutes of film
 can spool by as the last seven seconds tick off a bomb's count-down
 timer, while the seasons can change in the course of a five-second
 dissolve.  Even Fox's "24," a television series whose entire conceit
 is that the action is presented in real-time, can be seen on closer
 inspection to hew to its supposed real-time anchors only every ten
 minutes or so, where the ads are inserted; in between the ads, the
 normal bag of tricks is liberally employed to compress and expand
 time.</p>
 
 <p>In simulations, we have a different situation, because the pacing of
 the story is under the indirect control of the player.  (I call the
 control indirect because it's not presented to the player as a simple
 control knob with settings for "slower" and "faster."  The player can
 directly control how quickly she enters commands, but this has only a
 very minor effect on the pace of the story; the major component of
 the story's pacing is the player's rate of absorbing information from
 the story and synthesizing solutions to its obstacles.  In most
 cases, this is the gating factor: the player is motivated, by a
 desire to win the game, to go as fast as possible, but is unable to
 go any faster because of the need to perform time-consuming mental
 computation.  Thus the player's control is indirect; there's the
 illusion of a control knob for "faster" and "slower," but in practice
 the knob's setting is forced to a fixed value, determined by the
 player's ability to solve puzzles: no player ever wants to choose a
 "slower" setting than they have to, and the "faster" settings are
 unavailable because of the gating mental computation factor.)
 </p>
 
 <p>But even so, the player in a simulation does have complete control
 over the specific actions that the player character performs.  The
 player makes the character walk around, examine things, try a few
 random verbs on an object, walk around some more, and so on.  All of
 these things clearly ought to take time in the simulation.  The
 question is: how much time?
</p> 

 <p>The most obvious approach is to tie the passage of game-time to the
 actions the player character performs, by making each turn take some
 amount of time.  At the simplest, each turn could take a fixed amount
 of time, say 1 minute.  A more sophisticated approach might be for
 some kinds of actions to take more time than others; walking to a new
 room might take 2 minutes, say, while examining a wall might take 30
 seconds.  Some early IF games took this approach.  Infocom's
 <em>Planetfall</em>, for example, has a cycle of day and night that's tied to
 the number of turns taken by the player.</p>
    
 <p>Unfortunately, such a direct mapping of turns to game-time hasn't
 proved to be very satisfactory in practice.  This approach doesn't
 seem to make the treatment of time more realistic -- in fact, it's
 just the opposite.  For example, in <em>Planetfall</em>, as objective
 game-time passes, it's necessary to eat and sleep; the game has a
 limited supply of food, so if you spend too much time exploring, you
 can lock yourself out of victory simply by exhausting all available
 food and starving to death.  The workaround, of course, is to restart
 the game after you've explored enough to know your way around, at
 which point you can cruise through the parts you've been through
 before.  The end result is that we get two opposite but equally
 unrealistic treatments of time: on the first pass, far too much
 objective time passes as we wander around exploring, given how little
 we accomplish; and on the second pass, far too little objective time
 elapses, given how rapidly we progress through the story.
</p> 
   
 <p>One problem would seem to be that verbs are far too coarse a means to
 assign times to actions: picking up five small items off a table
 might take almost no time at all, while picking up the table itself
 could require a minute or two; walking to the next room might take
 ten seconds, while walking across an airport terminal takes ten
 minutes.  An author could in principle assign timings to actions at
 the level of individual verb-object combinations, but this would
 obviously be unmanageable in anything but the tiniest game.</p>  
    
 <p>A second problem is that it might be better to see the player's
actual sequence of command input as somewhat distinct from the player
character's subjective storyline.  In the turns-equals-time approach,
we're essentially asserting a literal equivalence between the
player's commands and the player character's story.  In typical IF
game play, the player spends quite a lot of time exploring,
examining, and experimenting.  If we were to imagine ourselves as an
observer inside the game world, what we'd see would be highly
unnatural and unrealistic: no one actually behaves like an IF player
character.  If we wanted to achieve more realism, we might consider
that the medium imposes a certain amount of this exploration activity
artificially, as a means for the player to gather information that
would, in reality, be immediately and passively accessible to the
player character - just by being there, the player character would
instantly absorb a lot of information that the player can only learn
by examination and experimentation.  Therefore, we could say that,
realistically, a lot of the exploration activity that a player
performs isn't really part of the story, but is just an artifact of
the medium, and thus shouldn't count against the story world's
internal clock.</p>
    
 <p>One ray of hope in all of this is that the human sense of time is
 neither precise nor objective.  People do have an innate sense of the
 passage of time, but it doesn't work anything like the
 turns-equals-time approach would have it.  People don't internally
 track time by counting up the actions they perform.  In fact, people
 generally don't even have a very precise intuitive sense for how long
 a particular action takes; in most cases, people are actually pretty
 bad at estimating the time it will take to perform ordinary tasks.
 (Unless you're asking about areas where they have a lot of hands-on
 experience actually timing things on a clock, such as you might find
 in certain professions.  And a lot of people aren't even good at that
  &mdash; just try getting a decent schedule estimate out of a programmer,
 for example.)</p>
  
 <p>The human sense of time is not, then, an objective accounting of
 recent activity.  Rather, it's a highly subjective sense, influenced
 by things like emotion and focus of attention.  A couple of familiar
 examples illustrate how a person's subjective experience of time can
 wildly depart from time's objective passage.  First, think about how
 time seems to stretch out when you have nothing to do but wait for
something, like when you're stuck in an airport waiting for a late
flight.  Second, think about how time flies by when you're doing
something that intensely focuses your attention, like when you're
playing a really good computer game or you're deeply engaged in a
favourite hobby: hours can seem to disappear into a black hole.  Being
bored tends to expand time, while being intensely occupied tends to
compress it.  There are other factors that affect the subjective time
sense, but occupation of attention seems to be one of the most
important.</p>
    
 <p>So where does this lead us?  If it's not clear which "turns" are part
 of the story and which are merely artifacts of the medium, the turn
 counter can't be a reliable source of game-time.  But if the human
sense of time is inherently subjective, then maybe we're better off
tying the passage of time to something other than the raw turn
counter anyway.</p>
    
 <p>The key to our solution is to treat the turn counter as correlated to
the player's subjective time, rather than the story's objective time.
In other words, rather than saying that a LOOK command actually takes
30 seconds in the game world, we say that a LOOK command might *feel*
like it takes some amount of time to the player, but that the actual
time it takes depends on what it accomplishes in the story.  How much
time really passes for a single LOOK command?  It all depends on how
many LOOK commands it takes to accomplish something.</p>
    
 <p>So, if the player spends long periods of time exploring and frobbing
around with objects, but not making any progress, we've had a lot of
subjective time pass (many turns), but very little story time (few
story-significant events).  This is exactly what people are used to
in real life: when you're bored and not accomplishing anything, time
seems to drag.  If the player starts knocking down puzzles left and
right, making great progress through the story, we suddenly have a
feeling of little subjective time passing (few turns) while story
time is flying past (many story-significant events).  Again, just
what we're used to in real life when deeply engaged in some activity.</p>
    
 <p>This basic approach isn't new.  Gareth Rees's <em>Christminster</em> includes
plot elements that occur at particular clock-times within the story,
and a working clock-tower to let the player character tell the time.
Time advances in the game strictly according to the player's progress
through the plot (i.e., solving puzzles).  At key plot events, the
clock advances; at all other times, it just stays fixed in place.
The game works around the "precision problem" (which we'll come to
shortly) with the somewhat obvious contrivance of omitting the
minute-hand from the clock, so the time can only be read to the
nearest hour.  Michael Gentry's <em>Anchorhead</em> also ties events to the
story's clock-time, and provides a story clock of sorts that advances
by the player's progress in solving puzzles.  <em>Anchorhead</em> handles the
precision problem by using an even coarser clock than <em>Christminster</em>,
specifically the position of the sun in the sky, which I think can
only be read to a precision of "day" or "night."  The
precision-avoiding contrivance here is much less obvious than in
<em>Christminster</em>, and it especially helps that the setting and
atmosphere of the game practically demand a continuous dark overcast.</p>
  
 <p>But what if we wanted a normal clock in the game - one with a minute
 hand?  This is where the precision problem comes in.  The problem
 with subjective time is that, in the real world, a tool-using human
 in possession of a wristwatch can observe the objective time whenever
 she wants.  In games like <em>Anchorhead</em> and <em>Christminster</em>, the clock
 only advances at key plot points, so if we permitted the player
 character a timepiece with a minute hand, we'd get unrealistic
 exchanges like this:</p>
    
 <pre>   
<strong>&gt;x watch</strong>
It's 3:05pm.
    
<strong>&gt;east. get bucket. west. fill bucket with water. drink water. east.</strong>
... done ...
  
<strong>&gt;etc, etc, etc...</strong>
... done ...
    
<strong>&gt;x watch</strong>
It's 3:05pm.
 </pre>
 
 
<p>That's why <em>Christminster</em> doesn't have a minute hand, and why
<em>Anchorhead</em> doesn't have clocks at all.  When the time is only
reported vaguely, the player won't notice that the clock is frozen
between plot events: it's not a problem when we're told that it's
still "some time after three" for dozens of turns in a row.</p>
   
 <p>This is where this implementation tries to add something new.  We try
 to achieve a compromise between an exclusively narrative advancement
of time, and an exclusively turn-based clock.  The goal is to have
the story drive the actual advancement of the clock, while still
giving plausible time readings whenever the player wants them.</p>
   
<p>The compromise hinges on the way people use clocks in the real world:
a person will typically glance at the clock occasionally, but not
watch it continuously.  Our approach also depends upon the
observation that people are generally bad at estimating how long a
particular activity takes.  If people are bad at judging the time for
one activity, then they're even worse at judging it for a series of
activities.  This is an advantage for us, because it means that the
"error bars" around a player's estimate of how long something ought
to be taking are inherently quite large, which in turn means that we
have a large range of plausible results &mdash; as long as we don't say
it's 3:05pm every time we're asked.</p>
    
<p>Here's the scheme.  We start by having the game assign the times of
important events.  The game doesn't have to tell us in advance about
everything; it only has to tell us the starting time, and the game
clock time of the next important event in the plot.  For example, the
game could tell us that it's now noon, and the next important plot
point will be when the player character manages to get into the
castle, which happens at 6pm, just as the sun is starting to set.
Note that the story asserts that this event happens at 6pm; it
doesn't matter how many turns it takes the player to solve the
puzzles and get into the castle, since *in the story*, we always get
in at 6pm.</p>  
 
 <p>If the player looks at a clock at the start of the game, they'll see
 that it's noon.  The clock module then starts keeping track of the
 number of turns the player takes.  The next time the player looks at
 a clock, we'll check to see how many turns it's been since the last
 look at the clock.  (We'll also consider plot points where the story
 actually sets the clock to be the same as the player looking at the
 clock, since these have the same effect of making us commit to a
 particular time.)  We'll scale this linearly to a number of minutes
 passing.  Then, we'll crank down this linear scaling factor according
 to how close we're getting to the next event time - this ensures that
 we'll leave ourselves room to keep the clock advancing without
 bumping up against the next event time.  So, we have a sort of Zeno's
 paradox factor: the closer we get to the next event time, the slower
 we'll approach it.</p>
    
 <p>The point is to create a plausible illusion of precision.  A player
 who checks infrequently, as should be typical, should see a plausible
 series of intermediate times between major plot points.</p>
    
 <p>One final note: if you want to display a clock in the status line, or
 show the current time with every prompt, this is the wrong module to
 use (use the <a href="objtime.htm">Objective Time</a> module instead).  A key assumption of the scheme implemented here is that the
 time will be checked only occasionally, when it occurs to the player
 to look.  If the game is constantly checking the time
 programmatically, it'll defeat the whole purpose, since we won't be
 able to exploit the player's presumed uncertainty about exactly how
 much time should have elapsed between checks.</p>
