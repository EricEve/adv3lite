<h1>Collective</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>This extension defines the <span class="code">Collective</span> and <span class="code">DispensingCollective</span> classes, which can help with situations where you have one object representing a collective (e.g. a bunch of grapes) and one or more objects representing items drawn from that collective (e.g. individual grapes). The Collective class helps overcome disambiguation issues when both the collective and individual items are in scope (e.g. when 'grapes' might refer either to the bunch of grapes or to one or more individual grapes) and the DispensingCollective class further assists with making the collective issue individual items on demand (e.g. TAKE GRAPE or TAKE GRAPE FROM BUNCH) can be made to move an individual grape into the player character's inventory even when no individual grape is yet in scope). </p>

<a name="usage"></a>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>Include the collective.t file after the library files but before your game source files. Define an object to be of either the Collective Class or the DispensingCollective class as discussed further below.</p>

<br>
<a name="collective"></a>
<h2>Collective Class</h2>
<p>The principal purpose of the <strong>Collective</strong> class is to resolve clashes that might otherwise occur between a collective (such as bunch of grapes) and individual items making up or taken from that collective. For example, supposed we defined an object representing a bunch of grapes together with a class to represent individual grapes thus:</p>

 <p><div class="code"><pre>
bunch: Thing 'bunch of grapes[n]'
  ...
;  
 
class Grape: Food 'grape; round green juicy loose'
  "It's round, green and juicy. "
  disambigName = 'loose grape'  
; 
 </pre></div>

<p>If we were then to define a number of grapes (objects of the Grape class) and any of them were in scope at the same time as the bunch object, the noun 'grapes' (by itself) would match either the bunch or any of the individual grapes (since adv3Lite automatically recognizes 'grapes' as the plural of 'grape'). This can lead to annoying disambiguation messages or unintended consequences in response to commands like TAKE GRAPES. Particularly when there is only one loose grape in scope along with the bunch of grapes, the player is likely to intend 'grapes' to refer to the bunch and 'grape' to the individual grape. The use of the disambigName alleviates this problem a little, but does not fully solve it. A better solution is to make the bunch a <span class="code">Collective</span>:</p> 

 <p><div class="code"><pre>
bunch: Collective 'bunch of grapes[n]'
      isCollectiveFor(obj) { return obj.ofKind(Grape); }
;
 </pre></div>
<a name="iscollective"></a>
<p>The first thing to note here is the use of the <strong>isCollectiveFor()</strong> method. In order to decide whether it or some other object should respond to the player's command, a <span class="code">Collective</span> needs to know what objects it needs to be distinguished from, that is, which objects it is acting as a collective for. In this case we want the parser to make the correct selection between the bunch of grapes and individual (loose) grapes; in other words the bunch is a collective for individual grapes, which in this case will be objects of the Grape class. We thus need <span class="code">isCollectiveFor(obj)</span> to return true if and only if <em>obj</em> is a Grape.</p>

<p>But there's more going on behind the scenes that immediately meets the eye here. How does the parser know when what the player types is meant to refer to the bunch rather than to loose grapes? It's clear enough if the player types BUNCH, but not so clear if the player types GRAPES. The answer is that the parser looks to see if what the player typed to described the object in question has any words (or 'tokens') in common with those defined on the Collective's <strong>collectiveToks</strong> property. In the example above, however, this property seems not to have been defined. In fact, if it's not defined by the user (game author), the library defines it automatically from the Collective's name property; so in the example above the <span class="code">collectiveToks</span> property is automatically set to <span class="code">['bunch', 'of', 'grapes']</span>.</p>

<p>Much of the time this will work perfectly well, but what if our Collective can be described in more than one way? Suppose, for example, we have a stack of cans object that can also be referred to as a pile of tins. If we left the library to set the <span class="code">collectiveToks</span> property the parser would still take CANS to refer to the stack rather than to one or more individual cans, but could not make the same distinction if the player typed TINS. One way to deal with this would be to set the <span class="code">collectiveToks</span> property manually:</p>

 <p><div class="code"><pre>
 canStack: Collective 'stack of cans;;pile tins'
    isCollectiveFor(obj) { return obj.ofKind(Can); }
    collectiveToks = ['stack', 'of', 'cans', 'pile', 'tins'] 
 ;
 </pre></div>
 
<p>This will work since the library will see that we've defined the <span class="code">collectiveToks</span> property for ourselves, so it won't overwrite it with the tokens from the name property, but it's a bit more typing than we need to do, since we've had to repeat the <span class="code">'stack', 'of', 'cans'</span> that the library would otherwise have dealt with for us. A better alternative, then, is to use the <strong>extraToks</strong> property. If the <span class="code">extraToks</span> property is defined as a list of tokens, these will be added to the list of tokens the library builds from the Collective's name when it initializes its <span class="code">collectiveToks</span> property. The above example could then be re-written: </p> 

 <p><div class="code"><pre>
 canStack: Collective 'stack of cans;;pile tins'
    isCollectiveFor(obj) { return obj.ofKind(Can); }
    extraToks = ['pile', 'tins'] 
 ;   
 </pre></div>

<p>Finally, action-processing code (<span class="code">dobjFor</span> and <span class="code">iobjFor</span> methods) defined on a Collective can test the value of its <strong>collectiveDobjMatch</strong> and <strong>collectiveIobjMatch</strong> properties to see whether the Collective was matched as either the direct or indirect object of the command using any of the tokens in its <span class="code">collectiveToks</span> property. This is useful when the Collective also includes singular words in its vocab (e.g. 'grape' or 'tin') so that the player can refer to an individual grape or tin before any have come into scope. The reason for this will become clearer when we go on to discuss the <span class="code">DispensingCollector</span> class.</p>


<br>
 <a name="dispensing"></a>
<h2>DispensingCollective Class</h2> 
<p>The <span class="code">Collective</span> class provides a helpful framework for helping the parser to choose between a collective (e.g. a bunch of grapes) and the individual objects for which it is a collective (e.g. individual grapes), but is otherwise a bit limited in what it can do. Often, if we have a collective object such as bunch of grapes, we want the player to be able to take individual items, such as grapes, from it. For this purpose we can use the <strong>DispensingCollective</strong> class. This is best explained by way of an example: here's how we might define a bunch of grapes from which the player will be allowed to take up to five grapes:</p>

 <p><div class="code"><pre>
bunch: DispensingCollective 'bunch of grapes[n]; another more; grape'
    dispensedClass = Grape
    
    maxToDispense = 5       
    
    cannotDispenseMsg = '{I}{\'ve} had quite enough grapes. '
    notEnoughLeftMsg = '{I} {don\'t need} that many grapes. '
; 
 </pre></div> 
 
<p>There are a number of points to note here. First, the word 'grape' is included as an addition noun in the noun section of the vocab property. This allows the player to type TAKE GRAPE even when there are no individual grapes in scope, since the Collective (bunch) object will match 'grape'. When it matches, however, its <span class="code">collectiveDobjMatch</span> property will be set to nil, since it did not match on any of the tokens on the bunch's <span class="code">collectiveToks</span> property. This tells the bunch object that the player wants to take an individual grape from the bunch rather than the whole bunch. We don't have to do anything to make this happen; this behaviour is all defined on the DispensingCollective class, so that the command TAKE GRAPE (or TAKE GRAOE FROM BUNCH) will result in the bunch object creating a new object of the Grape class and moving into the player character's inventory.</p>

<p>Once a separate grape object exists, however, (and while it's in scope at the same time as the bunch), the parser will take TAKE GRAPE (or any other command using the singular GRAPE) to refer to the loose grape rather than the bunch of grapes. That's why it's a good idea to add words like 'another' and 'more' as adjectives for the bunch object. Since the individual, loose grapes don't have these words in their vocab, commands like TAKE ANOTHER GRAPE or TAKE TWO MORE GRAPES must refer to the bunch object, and not to a Grape object, and so the result will be that the bunch once again creates and dispenses a new Grape to the player character (or, two grapes, if the command was TAKE TWO MORE GRAPES).</p>
<a name="max"></a>
<p>Presumably we don't, however, want the player to be able to take an infinite number of grapes from the bunch, so that's where the <strong>maxToDispense</strong> property comes in. This property defines the maximum number of grapes the player will be allowed to take from the bunch. If the player tries to take more then the bunch will complain using either its <strong>cannotDispenseMsg</strong>, if the player has taken the maximum number of grapes, or the <strong>notEnoughLeftMsg</strong> if there are still some grapes left to take but the player wants to take more than that number (e.g. TAKE THREE GRAPES when only two remain). The library does define default messages for both these properties, but they are sufficiently bland that you'll normally want to override them with your own (it's impossible to know in general the precise reason why you might want to restrict the number of items to issue to the specific number you choose).</p>

<p>As you can probably guess, the <strong>dispensedClass</strong> method is used to tell the Collective what class of object to create when the player wants it to dispense an individual object. As an alternative you can use the <strong>dispensedObjs</strong> property to hold a list of the objects that the Collective will dispense. For example, if you only wanted to allow the player to take a single grape from the bunch, then instead of defining a Grape class you could define a single grape object and the bunch thus:</p>

 <p><div class="code"><pre>
bunch: DispensingCollective 'bunch of grapes[n]; another more; grape'
    dispensedObjs = [grape]
       
    
    cannotDispenseMsg = '{I}{\'ve} had quite enough grapes. '
    notEnoughLeftMsg = '{I} {don\'t need} that many grapes. '
; 
 </pre></div> 
 
<p>Note that in this instance there's no need to define the <span class="code">maxToDispense</span> property, since the maximum number of objects that can be dispensed is simply the length of the <span class="code">dispensedObjs</span> list. Note finally that whether you define <span class="code">dispensedClass</span> or <span class="code">dispensedObjs</span>, there is no need to define the <span class="code">isCollectiveFor(obj)</span> method on a <span class="code">DispensingCollective</span>, since it this method is already defined there, and can figure out whether <em>obj</em> is something the DispensingCollective is a collective for from its <span class="code">dispensedClass</span> or <span class="code">dispensedObjs</span> property.</p> 
 
<a name="exhaust"></a> 
<p>The <strong>exhaustDispenser()</strong> provides a further way to customize the behaviour of a DispensingCollective. It's called when the DispensingCollective dispenses its final item. By default it does nothing, but it can easily be overridden to carry out some side-effect of running out of items to dispense, such as changing the description, for example:</p> 
 
 <p><div class="code"><pre>
bunch: DispensingCollective 'bunch of grapes[n]; another more ;grape'
    dispensedClass = Grape
    
    maxToDispense = 5       
    
    cannotDispenseMsg = '{I}{\'ve} had quite enough grapes. '
    notEnoughLeftMsg = '{I} {don\'t need} that many grapes. '
    
    exhaustDispenser()
    {
        setMethod(&desc, 'The bunch is looking a bit depleted; there aren\'t
            really any grapes left that are worth taking. ');        
    }
; 
 </pre></div> 
 
<p>If we had been dealing with a bunch of bananas rather than a bunch of grapes, the effect of taking the last banana from the bunch (when there are two bananas left) would be to leave a single banana behind, so we might do something like this:</p> 

 <p><div class="code"><pre>
 bananaBunch: DispensingCollective 'bunch of bananas[n]; another more; banana'
    "There are &lt;&lt;spellNumber(numLeft)&gt;&gt; bananas left on the bunch. "
    
    dispensedClass = Banana

    maxToDispense = 5
    
    exhaustDispenser()
    {
        local b = new Banana;
        b.moveInto(location);
        moveInto(nil);
    }
;
 </pre></div> 
<br>
<a name='complications'></a>

<p>There are two further properties of DispensingCollective that can be used to tweak responses: <b>dispenserName</b> snd <b>exhaustedName</b>. Their use is best explained by an example that also illustrates the handling of further complications.</p>

<p>Suppose we have an orchard location containing a number of apple trees from which a limited number of which of apples can be picked (since the remainder are out of reach). It's more appropriate for the apples growing on the trees to be the <span class='code'>DispensingCollective</span> than the trees themselves, so we'd need to define them as two separate objects and then relate them appropriately. One way to handle this would be as follows:</p>

 <p><div class="code"><pre>
 + appleTrees: Fixture 'apple trees;;tree;them it'
    "Most of the trees are laden with apples, &lt;&lt;if ripeApples.numLeft &gt; 0 &gt;&gt;only a few of which are
    &lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt; but none of them appear to be &lt;&lt;end&gt;&gt; in easy reach. "
    
    iobjFor(TakeFrom) {  remap = ripeApples }
    
;

++ ripeApples: DispensingCollective 'ripe apples; unpicked juicy hanging more another; 
    apple fruit; them'
    "The apples hanging from the trees look ripe and juicy. "

    disambigName = 'unpicked apple'
    dispensedClass = Apple
    maxToDispense = 2
    dispenserName = 'one of the apple trees'
    exhaustedName = 'any of the apple trees'
    isFixed = true
    
    cannotTakeMsg = 'Even if you could reach them all, you could hardly take all the apples at
        once. '
    
    // cannotDispenseMsg = 'It looks like you\'ve picked all the low-hanging fruit. '
;

class Apple: Food 'apple;;fruit'
;
</pre></div> 
<br>
<p>The points to note here are:</p>
<ul>
<lI>We vary the description of he apple trees according to whether there are any more apples available to be picked.</li>
<li>We remap an attempt to take apples from the tree to taking them from ripeApples.</li>
<li>We don't want to see a message like 'You take an apple from the ripe apples.' We can avoid that by overriding the <span class='code'>dispenserName</span> to something more appropriate, here 'one of the apple trees'. If we don't override it, <span class='code'>dispenserName</span> simply takes its value from <span class='code'>theName</span>.</li>
<li>The <span class='code'>exhaustedName</span> property works in the same way to provide an appropriate name to use in the message to say there are no more apples to take. By default, it takes its value from <span class='code'>dispenserName</span>, but here 'You can’t take any more from any of the apple trees' wouldn't quite work, so we override it to 'any of the apple trees'.</li>
<li>Alternatively, we could have overridden <span class='code'>cannotDispenseMsg</span> to a more customised message, in which case <span class='code'>exhaustedName</span> wouldn't be used.</li>
<lI>The apples hanging from the trees aren't something the player character can pick up and walk around with as a whole, so we need to ensure that their <span class='code'>isFixed</span> property is true. But neither do we want TAKE UNPICKED APPLES to me met with 'The ripe appies are fixed in place', so we also need to override <span class='code'>cannotTakeMsg</span> to something more appropriate.</li>
</ul>
