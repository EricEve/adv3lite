/* 
 *   A Signal is a kind of Relation that can be used to send a signal from a
 *   sender to all the objects related to that sender via this Signal Relation.
 *
 *   For a signal to be sent from a sender to a receiver, a relationship first
 *   needs to be set up between them with a statement like:
 *
 *   connect(sender, signal, receiver);
 *
 *   Where signal is either the programmatic name or the string name of the
 *   signal we want sent.
 *
 *   To break the link subsequently we can use:
 *
 *   unconnect(sender, signal, receiver);
