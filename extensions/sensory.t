/*
 *   sensory.t
 *
 *   The SENSORY extension is intended for use with the adv3Lite library. It
 *   adds slightly more sophisticated handling for smells and sounds, as well as
 *   a new SensoryEvent class which can be useful for making actors and other
 *   objects respond to sensory events.
 *
 *   VERSION 2
 *.  19-Jul-14
 *
 *   Usage: include this extension after the adv3Lite library but before your
 *   own game-specific files. Make sure that events.t is also included in your
 *   build.
