<a name="61"></a>     *   TADS provides several different RNG algorithms; each RNG has
<a name="62"></a>     *   different properties, so some applications might have reasons to
<a name="63"></a>     *   prefer a particular algorithm.  For general purposes, any of them

<a name="65"></a>     *   
<a name="66"></a>     *   The interpreter automatically makes a call to randomize() (the
<a name="67"></a>     *   no-arguments version) when it starts up, unless the user specifies
<a name="68"></a>     *   the "-norand" option when launching the interpreter.  For most
<a name="69"></a>     *   programs, this means that you'll never have to make your own call to
<a name="70"></a>     *   randomize() - you can just call rand() when you need random numbers.
<a name="71"></a>     *   
<a name="72"></a>     *   This function performs several tasks, depending on how you invoke
<a name="73"></a>     *   it:
<a name="74"></a>     *   
<a name="75"></a>     *.    randomize() - selects the default RNG algorithm (ISAAC), and seeds
<a name="76"></a>     *.          the RNG with truly random data from the operating system.
<a name="77"></a>     *   
<a name="78"></a>     *.    randomize(nil) - retrieves the current state of the RNG.  Returns
<a name="79"></a>     *.          a list: [id, state], where 'id' is the ID of the currently
<a name="80"></a>     *.          selected RNG algorithm, and 'state' is a value containing
<a name="81"></a>     *.          its internal state, which can be used in a later call to
<a name="82"></a>     *.          randomize([id, state]) to restore the RNG state.  The 'state'
<a name="83"></a>     *.          value is opaque, meaning that it's not meant to be used
<a name="84"></a>     *.          directly; the only thing you should do with it it save it
<a name="85"></a>     *.          for later if you should want to restore this state later.
<a name="86"></a>     *   
<a name="87"></a>     *.    randomize([id, state]) - if you pass in a list that obtained from
<a name="88"></a>     *.          an earlier call to randomize(nil), the RNG will be returned
<a name="89"></a>     *.          to its state at the time of the randomize(nil) call.  This
<a name="90"></a>     *.          selects the same RNG algorithm that was in effect then and
<a name="91"></a>     *.          restores the internal state of the generator.  After calling
<a name="92"></a>     *.          this, a series of calls to rand() will return the same
<a name="93"></a>     *.          sequence of numbers that were returned after the call to
<a name="94"></a>     *.          randomize(nil).
<a name="95"></a>     *   
<a name="96"></a>     *.    randomize(id) - selects the RNG algorithm identified by 'id'
<a name="97"></a>     *.          (an RNG_Xxx value).  This doesn't change the state of
<a name="98"></a>     *.          the generator; it simply selects the algorithm.
<a name="99"></a>     *   
<a name="100"></a>     *.    randomize(id, nil) - selects the RNG algorithm identified by
<a name="101"></a>     *.          'id' (an RNG_Xxx value), and seeds the generator with
<a name="102"></a>     *.          truly random data obtained from the operating system.
<a name="103"></a>     *   
<a name="104"></a>     *.    randomize(id, val) - selects the RNG algorithm identified by
<a name="105"></a>     *.          'id' (an RNG_Xxx value), and seeds the generator with
<a name="106"></a>     *.          the initial value 'val'.  This can be either an integer
<a name="107"></a>     *.          value or a string; the preferred format varies by
<a name="108"></a>     *.          algorithm, but they'll all accept either format.  After
<a name="109"></a>     *.          you set a given seed value, rand() will return a sequence
<a name="110"></a>     *.          of numbers that's repeatable every time you set the same
<a name="111"></a>     *.          seed value.  This can be useful for things like testing,
<a name="112"></a>     *.          where you want a sequence of numbers that's statistically
<a name="113"></a>     *.          random, but which can be reproduced on demand.
<a name="114"></a>     *   
<a name="115"></a>     *   Most programs that require random numbers want a truly unpredictable
<a name="116"></a>     *   series of numbers - that is, numbers that have a statistically
<a name="117"></a>     *   random distribution, with no discernible patterns, and which will be
<a name="118"></a>     *   different every time the program is run.  There are two separate
<a name="119"></a>     *   parts to this proposition, and they're handled by separate
<a name="120"></a>     *   functions.  rand() fulfills the first part: it uses a mathematical
<a name="121"></a>     *   formula to generate a series of numbers that are statistically
<a name="122"></a>     *   distributed in a random fashion (for example, so that "1" occurs as
<a name="123"></a>     *   often as "10" or any other number, any given sequence of 2, 3, or
<a name="124"></a>     *   more numbers is equally likely, and so on: mathematicians have many
<a name="125"></a>     *   formal tests that RNGs must satisfy to be considered random.)
<a name="126"></a>     *   randomize() fulfills the second part, which is making sure that the
<a name="127"></a>     *   sequence of numbers is different every time you run the program.
<a name="128"></a>     *   The reason this second part is important is that rand() is by its
<a name="129"></a>     *   nature deterministic: it's defined entirely in terms of a formula,
<a name="130"></a>     *   so given the same initial conditions, it'll always crank out the
<a name="131"></a>     *   same sequence of numbers.  The trick is to randomize its initial
<a name="132"></a>     *   conditions - and what makes it tricky is that we can't just turn to
<a name="133"></a>     *   rand(), since it's the thing we're trying to randomize!
<a name="134"></a>     *   
<a name="135"></a>     *   This is where the "seed" values come in.  randomize() and
<a name="136"></a>     *   randomize(id, nil) ask the operating system for truly random data to
<a name="137"></a>     *   use for the initial conditions.  The degree of entropy in this OS
<a name="138"></a>     *   seed data varies by system; some systems have better entropy sources
<a name="139"></a>     *   than others.  But whatever the source, the seed data should be
<a name="140"></a>     *   different each time you run the program.  randomize() feeds this
<a name="141"></a>     *   seed data into the RNG to set its initial conditions, so each time
<a name="142"></a>     *   you run, rand() will be starting from a different initial state.
<a name="143"></a>     *   This makes for a different series of numbers from rand() on each
<a name="144"></a>     *   run.
<a name="145"></a>     *   
<a name="146"></a>     *   Note that it's not necessary (or desirable) to call randomize()
<a name="147"></a>     *   every time you want a random number.  Once you seed the RNG, rand()
<a name="148"></a>     *   is all you need to call.  It can be slow to gather the true random
<a name="149"></a>     *   data that randomize() uses, since this sometimes requires
<a name="150"></a>     *   interacting with hardware devices or scanning large amounts of
<a name="151"></a>     *   system data.  rand() is quite fast, since it just calculates a
<a name="152"></a>     *   number using a formula.  Depending on the system, rand() might also
<a name="153"></a>     *   be more reliable at producing high volumes of statistically random
<a name="154"></a>     *   data than the OS sources.  The operating system sources of true
<a name="155"></a>     *   entropy don't always change quickly, so it's better to use them
<a name="156"></a>     *   infrequently, such as just once at the start of program execution,
<a name="157"></a>     *   than to use them as a routine source of random numbers.
<a name="158"></a>     *   
<a name="159"></a>     *   The fixed seed values, with randomize(id, val), do something a
<a name="160"></a>     *   little different.  Rather than making the RNG produce different
<a name="161"></a>     *   sequences on each run, a fixed seed makes rand() generate the same
<a name="162"></a>     *   series of numbers every time.  The numbers will still be
<a name="163"></a>     *   statistically random, but each time you run the program, you'll get
<a name="164"></a>     *   the same seaquence.  (The sequence is a function of the seed value.
<a name="165"></a>     *   You'll get a different sequence for each different seed value.)
<a name="166"></a>     *   
<a name="167"></a>     *   Why would you want a fixed series of rand() results?  One big reason
<a name="168"></a>     *   is testing.  One popular way to test software is regression testing,
<a name="169"></a>     *   where you run the program and compare its output to a reference
<a name="170"></a>     *   version that you know is correct.  If there are no differences, you
<a name="171"></a>     *   know that changes you've made to the program since haven't broken
<a name="172"></a>     *   anything in the test script.  Randomization interferes with this
<a name="173"></a>     *   kind of testing, because it makes the output different on each run -
<a name="174"></a>     *   it's useless to do a simple mechanical comparison of the new and old
<a name="175"></a>     *   output because they'll always differ.  Fixed seeds to the rescue.
<a name="176"></a>     *   Using a fixed seed, you can still exercise the program's random
<a name="177"></a>     *   behavior, but the sequence of random behavior will repeat on every
<a name="178"></a>     *   run, so you run those regression comparisons after all.  The really
<a name="179"></a>     *   great thing is that you don't have to make big changes to the
<a name="180"></a>     *   program if you want to switch between test mode and real randomness
<a name="181"></a>     *   - all you have to do is change the one call to randomize().

<a name="674"></a>     *   the end of the match in a forward search and the start of the match
