<a name="181"></a>     *   Note that we define the genders as three separate properties, so
<a name="182"></a>     *   the genders are NOT mutually exclusive - an object can be a "him",
<a name="183"></a>     *   a "her", and an "it" at the same time.  This is because a single
<a name="184"></a>     *   object can have multiple grammatical genders in some languages.
<a name="185"></a>     *   In English, for example, an animal can be referred to as gendered
<a name="186"></a>     *   (matching its physical gender) or neuter; and a few inanimate
<a name="187"></a>     *   objects have a sort of optional, idiomatic gender, such as
<a name="188"></a>     *   referring to a ship or country as "her".  
<a name="189"></a>     *   
<a name="190"></a>     *   Some languages might need additional genders.  When needed,
<a name="191"></a>     *   LMentionable should simply define suitable additional properties.
<a name="192"></a>     *   
<a name="193"></a>     *   In most gendered languages, the grammatical gender is an attribute
<a name="194"></a>     *   of the noun, not of the object.  In particular, if an object has
<a name="195"></a>     *   two nouns in its vocabulary, the two nouns might be of different

<a name="299"></a>     *   The most common situation where pickiness is called for is when two
<a name="300"></a>     *   objects happen to share some of the same vocabulary words, but certain
<a name="301"></a>     *   words orderings clearly refer to only one or the other. With the
<a name="302"></a>     *   unordered approach, this can be a nuisance for the player because it
<a name="303"></a>     *   can trigger disambiguation questions that seem unnecessary.  Overriding
<a name="304"></a>     *   matchName() to be picky about word order for those specific objects can
<a name="305"></a>     *   often fix this. In this implementation the matchPhrases property can be
<a name="306"></a>     *   used for this purpose.
<a name="307"></a>     *
<a name="308"></a>     *   Another example is ensuring the user knows the correct full name of an
<a name="309"></a>     *   object as part of a puzzle: you can override matchName() to make sure
<a name="310"></a>     *   the user doesn't accidentally stumble on the object by using one of its
<a name="311"></a>     *   vocabulary words to refer to something else nearby.  Another example is
<a name="312"></a>     *   matching words that aren't in the vocabulary list, such as a game
<a name="313"></a>     *   object that represents a group of apparent objects that have a whole
<a name="314"></a>     *   range of labels ("post office box 123", say).

<a name="9913"></a> *   assign its own vocabulary, vocabulary it gets from its parent will be
<a name="9914"></a> *   available in addition to that. For example, a car might have a remapIn
<a name="9915"></a> *   SubComponent which can be referred to as 'interior' and a remapUnder
<a name="9916"></a> *   SubComponent which can be referred to as 'undercarriage'. A car presumably
<a name="9917"></a> *   has a windows and a windshield (hence isTransparent = true on the remapIn
<a name="9918"></a> *   SubComponent), so if you're inside it then you can still see the exterior,
<a name="9919"></a> *   and so 'car' will be matched preferentially to the parent object. However,
<a name="9920"></a> *   an action such as 'TOUCH CAR', which is illogical for the exterior because
<a name="9921"></a> *   it can only be seen and not reached, will instead apply to the
<a name="9922"></a> *   SubComponent. On the other hand, if  you're inside a truck trailer and
<a name="9923"></a> *   can't see out, then the exterior is not even in scope and so 'truck' will
<a name="9924"></a> *   match on the SubComponent with no penalty applied.
<a name="9925"></a> *
<a name="9926"></a> *   For all purposes other than those described above, the SubComponent is a
<a name="9927"></a> *   distinct object from its parent, and does not delegate any of its
<a name="9928"></a> *   behavior. In particular, sense-related properties such as 'desc' are not
<a name="9929"></a> *   delegated. Therefore, if the SubComponent can ever have vocabulary then
<a name="9930"></a> *   you will likely want to implement some of these. Passing them through to
<a name="9931"></a> *   the parent is usually not appropriate, because, e.g., the interior or the
<a name="9932"></a> *   undercarriage of a car should probably be described differently than the
