   HTTP Request object.  This object represents an HTTP protocol request   from a client to one of our servers.  HTTPRequest objects are created by   the HTTPServer object as requests arrive, and are passed to the byte   code program as network events, via the getNetEvent() function.  The   program uses the object to get information on the request and to send   back the reply.

This completes a chunked reply started with   startChunkedReply().  After calling this routine, the request is   completed, and no further reply can be sent. <p>   'headers' is an optional list of additional headers to send with the   end of the reply.  The HTTP chunked reply mechanism allows a server   to send headers at the beginning of the reply (which corresponds to   the startChunkedReply() call), at the end of the reply (in this   routine), or both.  This accommodates situations where the server   might not be able to determine the final value for a header until   after generating full reply.  If this argument is included, it works   just like the 'headers' argument to sendReply(). <p>

<a name="getBody"></a>
<table class=decl><tr><td><code>getBody ( )</code><td align=right><code><a href="../file/httpreq.h.html">httpreq.h</a>[<a href="../source/httpreq.h.html#184">184</a>]</table><div class=desc>   Get the body of the request, if any.  Some types of HTTP requests,   such as POST and PUT, contain a message body.  This returns the raw,   unparsed message body.  Returns a File object, open with read-only   access. If there's no message body at all, this returns nil. <p>   If the body is a text type, the file will be open in text mode, with   the character mapping set according to the content type passed from   the client; otherwise it's open in raw binary mode. <p>   The message body retrieved here is the raw request payload, without   any processing.  There are two standard structured body types that   are frequently used with POSTs, both of which require further   parsing.  First is MIME type application/x-www-form-urlencoded,   which is used to represent a basic HTML form, and encodes the data   entry fields in a form; this type can be parsed via the   getFormFields() method.  Second is multipart/form-data, which is   used to POST forms that include uploaded files; this can be parsed   with getFormFields() to retrieve the data fields, and getUploads()   to get the uploaded file data. <p>

This returns a list:   ['ip-address', port], where 'ip-address' is a string with the IP   address of the client, in decimal notation ('192.168.1.15', for   example), and 'port' is an integer giving the network port number on   the client side. <p>
</div>
<a name="getCookie"></a>
<table class=decl><tr><td><code>getCookie (name)</code><td align=right><code><a href="../file/httpreq.h.html">httpreq.h</a>[<a href="../source/httpreq.h.html#123">123</a>]</table><div class=desc>   Look up a cookie.  This looks for the given cookie name in the   cookies sent by the client, and returns a string containing the   cookie's text if found.  If the cookie isn't found, returns nil. <p>
</div>
<a name="getCookies"></a>
<table class=decl><tr><td><code>getCookies ( )</code><td align=right><code><a href="../file/httpreq.h.html">httpreq.h</a>[<a href="../source/httpreq.h.html#132">132</a>]</table><div class=desc>   Get the cookies sent with the request by the client.  This returns a   LookupTable of the cookies, with each key set to a cookie name and   the corresponding value set to the cookie's text.  Cookies are   assumed to contain only plan ASCII characters; any 8-bit characters   in a cookie's name or value will be replaced by '?' characters. <p>
</div>
<a name="getFormFields"></a>
<table class=decl><tr><td><code>getFormFields ( )</code><td align=right><code><a href="../file/httpreq.h.html">httpreq.h</a>[<a href="../source/httpreq.h.html#161">161</a>]</table><div class=desc>   Get the form data-entry field values.  This returns a LookupTable   containing the field values sent with the request.  Each key in the   table is a field name (given by the NAME property of the HTML   &lt;INPUT&gt; tag for the field), and each corresponding value is a string   giving the value of the field as entered by the user. <p>   If the form includes uploaded files (via &lt;INPUT TYPE=FILE&gt;), the   value of each file field will be a FileUpload object instead of a   string.  The 'file' property of this object contains a File object,   opened in read-only mode, that can be used to retrieve the contents   of the uploaded file.  Other properties of object provide the   client-side name of the file and the MIME type specified by the   browser. <p>   This method is a convenience function that parses the message body   information.  You can obtain the raw information on the posted data   via the getHeader() method. <p>   This method recognizes form data as a message body with content-type   application/x-www-form-urlencoded or multipart/form-data.  If the   request doesn't have a message body at all, or has a message body   with a different content-type, this method assumes that the request   has no posted form data and returns nil.  We return nil rather than   an empty lookup table so that the caller can tell that this doesn't   appear to be a form submission request at all. <p>
</div>
<a name="getHeaders"></a>
<table class=decl><tr><td><code>getHeaders ( )</code><td align=right><code><a href="../file/httpreq.h.html">httpreq.h</a>[<a href="../source/httpreq.h.html#116">116</a>]</table><div class=desc>   Get the headers sent with the request by the client.  This returns a   LookupTable object: the keys are the header names, and the values   are the corresponding header values.  For example, for a POST, there   might be a 'Content-type' key with the corresponding value   'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'. <p>   The element table[1] contains the HTTP request line - the first line   of the request, which isn't technically a header.  This line   contains the verb, the query string, and (optionally) the HTTP   version string (in that order, with spaces separating the elements).   The method includes this so that you can inspect the unparsed   request line, if desired. <p>
</div>
<a name="getQuery"></a>
<table class=decl><tr><td><code>getQuery ( )</code><td align=right><code><a href="../file/httpreq.h.html">httpreq.h</a>[<a href="../source/httpreq.h.html#60">60</a>]</table><div class=desc>   Get the query string.  This is the portion of the URL after the   server address.  For example, if the client web browser navigated to   the URL "http://www.tads.org:1234/path/resource?a=1&amp;b=2" would   return "/path/resource?a=1&amp;b=2". <p>   This is the raw query string, exactly as the client sent it.  Any   '%xx' character sequences are still present in this version of the   string. <p>
</div>
<a name="getQueryParam"></a>
<table class=decl><tr><td><code>getQueryParam (name)</code><td align=right><code><a href="../file/httpreq.h.html">httpreq.h</a>[<a href="../source/httpreq.h.html#100">100</a>]</table><div class=desc>   Get a parameter from the query string.  This parses the query string   and returns the parameter with the specified name, if present, or   nil if not.  This does the same parsing as parseQuery(), but it   returns just the specified parameter value rather than building a   lookup table with all of the parameters.  This is more efficient   than parseQuery() if you're just looking up one or two parameters,   since it avoids building the whole table, but it's less efficient if   you're looking up many parameters because this routine has to   re-parse the query string on each call. <p>
</div>
<a name="getServer"></a>
<table class=decl><tr><td><code>getServer ( )</code><td align=right><code><a href="../file/httpreq.h.html">httpreq.h</a>[<a href="../source/httpreq.h.html#35">35</a>]</table><div class=desc>   Get the HTTPServer object.  This is the server that received the   network request that 'self' represents. <p>
</div>
<a name="getVerb"></a>
<table class=decl><tr><td><code>getVerb ( )</code><td align=right><code><a href="../file/httpreq.h.html">httpreq.h</a>[<a href="../source/httpreq.h.html#48">48</a>]</table><div class=desc>   Get the verb.  This is the HTTP verb that the client sent with the   request to indicate what action to perform.  The standard HTTP verbs   are GET (this is the most common request type; it simply retrieves a   resource from the server), POST (used to submit form data), OPTIONS,   HEAD, PUT, DELETE, TRACE, CONNECT, and PATCH.  If the client sends a   non-standard verb, the system simply passes it through to the   request, allowing you to write a custom server for a custom client;   however, this isn't recommended, since proxies and firewalls often   block what they consider ill-formed requests. <p>
</div>
<a name="parseQuery"></a>
<table class=decl><tr><td><code>parseQuery ( )</code><td align=right><code><a href="../file/httpreq.h.html">httpreq.h</a>[<a href="../source/httpreq.h.html#87">87</a>]</table><div class=desc>   Parse the query string.  This returns a LookupTable containing the   parsed elements of the query.  The element table[1] is the base   resource name: this is the part of the query string up to the first   '?', if any, or the entire query string if there are no parameters.   If there are any parameters, they're entered in the table under the   parameter names as keys.  For example, for this query string: <p> <br>    http://www.tads.org:1234/path/resource?a=one&amp;b=two&amp;c=three&amp;d <p>   we'd generate this table: <p> <br>    table[1] = '/path/resource' <br>    table['a'] = 'one' <br>    table['b'] = 'two' <br>    table['c'] = 'three' <br>    table['d'] = '' <p>   For all of the strings (including the base resource name, the   parameter names, and the parameter values), any '%xx' sequences are   converted into the corresponding character values.  For example, if   the base resource name is '/C%C3%A1fe', the resource name will be   parsed to 'C�fe' (%C3%A1 is the percent-encoded representation of   the UTF-8 character small A with acute accent). <p>
</div>
<a name="sendReply"></a>
<table class=decl><tr><td><code>sendReply (body, contentType?, status?, headers?)</code><td align=right><code><a href="../file/httpreq.h.html">httpreq.h</a>[<a href="../source/httpreq.h.html#289">289</a>]</table><div class=desc>   Send the reply to the request. <p>   'body' is the content of the reply.  For example, for a request for   an HTML page, this would contain the HTML text of the page.  This   can be a string or StringBuffer, in which case the string is sent as   UTF-8 data; a ByteArray, in which case the raw bytes of the byte   array are sent exactly as given; an integer, in which case the body   will be a default HTML page automatically generated for the   corresponding HTML status code; a File object opened with read   access, in which case the contents of the file will be sent; or nil,   in which case no message body is sent at all (just the status code   and the headers).  A file open in text mode will be sent as text,   and raw mode will be sent as binary.  "Data" mode isn't allowed.   Note that if a file is used, this will send the entire contents of   the file, regardless of the current seek position, and the routine   will have the side effect of setting the file's seek position to end   of file upon return. <p>   'contentType' is an optional string giving the MIME type of the   reply body.  This is used to generate a Content-type header in the   reply.  If this is omitted, the server generates a default MIME type   according to the type of the 'body' argument.  If 'body' is given as   a string, and the string starts with &lt;HTML (ignoring any initial   whitespace), the default content type is "text/html"; if the string   starts with &lt;?XML, the default type is "text/xml"; otherwise the   default type is "text/plain".  If 'body' is a ByteArray, the server   checks the first few bytes for signature strings for a few known   types (JPEG, PNG, MP3, Ogg, MIDI), and uses the corresponding MIME   type if matched; otherwise the MIME type is set to   "application/octet-stream".  'contentType' is ignored when the   'body' argument is an integer (because in this case the body is   known to be HTML), or hwen it's nil (since there's no body at all in   this case). <p>   When the 'body' is a string, the server automatically adds the   "charset" parameter to the Content-type header with value "utf-8". <p>   'status' is an optional HTTP status code.  This can be a string, in   which case it must have the standard format for an HTTP status code,   which consists of a decimal status code number followed by the text   description of the code: for example, "404 Not Found.  This argument   can alternatively be a simple integer giving one of the standard   HTTP status code numbers, in which case we'll automatically add the   corresponding status code text.  If this argument is omitted, AND   the 'body' is given as an integer, the 'body' value will be used as   the status code.  If this is omitted and there's a non-integer   'body' argument, we use "200 OK" as the default status code. <p>   'headers' is an optional list of header strings.  Each element of   the list is a string giving one header, in the standard format   "Name: Value".  If this is omitted, the reply will contain only the   standard headers synthesized by the server. <p>   The server automatically generates certain headers with each reply.   These should not be specified in the 'headers' argument.  The   standard headers are: <p> <br>    Content-type: per the 'contentType' argument <br>    Content-length: length in bytes of 'body' <p>   After sending the reply, the request is completed, and no further   reply can be sent. <p>
</div>
<a name="sendReplyAsync"></a>
<table class=decl><tr><td><code>sendReplyAsync (body, contentType?, status?, headers?)</code><td align=right><code><a href="../file/httpreq.h.html">httpreq.h</a>[<a href="../source/httpreq.h.html#375">375</a>]</table><div class=desc>   Send the reply to the request asynchronously.  This works like   sendReply(), except that this method starts a new background thread   to handle the data transfer and then immediately returns.  This   allows the caller to continue servicing other requests while the   data transfer proceeds, which is important when sending a large file   (such as a large image or audio file) as the reply body.  Most   browsers allow the user to continue interacting with the displayed   page while images and audio files are transfered in the background,   so it's likely that the browser will generate new requests during   the time it takes to send a single large reply body.  When you use   sendReply(), the server won't be able to service any of those new   requests until the reply is fully sent, so the browser will appear   unresponsive for the duration of the reply data transfer.  Using   sendReplyAsync() allows you to service new requests immediately,   without waiting for the data transfer to complete. <p>   The parameters are the same as for sendReply().  If 'body' is a   File, this function opens its own separate handle to the file, so   you're free to close the File object immediately, or to continue to   use it for other operations.  Note that if you continue writing to   the file after calling this method, it's unpredictable whether the   reply data will contain the original or updated data (or a mix of   new and old data), since the reply data transfer is handled in a   separate thread that runs in parallel with the main program. <p>   When the reply data transfer is completed, or if it fails, the   system posts a NetEvent of type NetEvReplyDone to the network   message queue.  The event contains the original HTTPRequest object,   to allow you to relate the event back to the request that generated   the reply, and status information indicating whether or not the   transfer was successful. <p>

<a name="sendReplyCatch"></a>
<table class=decl><tr><td><code>sendReplyCatch (reply, contType?, stat?, headers?)</code><td align=right><code><a href="../file/webui.t.html">webui.t</a>[<a href="../source/webui.t.html#122">122</a>]</table><div class=desc>   Send a reply, catching "socket disconnect" exceptions.  In most   cases, server objects will want to use this method rather than the   native sendReply() so that they won't have to handle disconnect   exceptions manually. <p>   Disconnect exceptions are common with HTTP: the protocol is   stateless by design, so clients can close their sockets at any   time.  Most modern browsers use HTTP 1.1, which allows the client   to maintain an open socket indefinitely and reuse it serially for   multiple requests, but browsers tend to close these reusable   sockets after a few minutes of inactivity. <p>   When this routine encounters a disconnected socket, it deletes the   client session record for the request, and then otherwise ignores   the error.  This generally makes the client's socket management   transparent to the server, since if the client is still running   they'll just connect again with a new socket and retry any lost   requests. <p>

This can be called any number of   times after calling startChunkedReply() to send the pieces of a   chunked reply. <p>   'body' can be a string or StringBuffer, in which case the string   data are sent as UTF-8 text; or a ByteArray, in which case the raw   bytes are sent. <p>

<a name="setCookie"></a>
<table class=decl><tr><td><code>setCookie (name, value)</code><td align=right><code><a href="../file/httpreq.h.html">httpreq.h</a>[<a href="../source/httpreq.h.html#223">223</a>]</table><div class=desc>   Set a cookie in the reply.  This sets a cookie with the given name   and value, both given as strings.  The value string starts with the   text to set for the cookie, and can be followed by additional   parameters, delimited by semicolons: <p> <br>  expires=Fri, 31-Dec-2010 23:59:59 GMT  - set expiration date <br>  domain=.tads.org                       - scope cookie to domain <br>  path=/                                 - scope cookie within site <br>  httponly                               - hide cookie from Javascript <br>  secure                                 - only send via https:// <p>   (These are all defined by the HTTP protocol, not by TADS.  For   details, refer to any HTTP reference book or web site.) <p>   A cookie without an expiration date is a session cookie: it   implicitly expires as soon as the browser application terminates.   The presence of an expiration date makes the cookie persistent,   meaning it's to be stored on disk until the given expiration date   and should survive even after the browser is closed. <p>   To send a cookie, you must call this BEFORE sending the reply or   starting to send a chunked reply.  This is a limitation of the   protocol, since the cookies must be sent at the start of the reply   with the headers.  Calling this routine doesn't actually send   anything immediately to the client, but simply stores the cookie   with the pending request, to be sent with the reply. <p>
</div>
<a name="startChunkedReply"></a>
<table class=decl><tr><td><code>startChunkedReply (contentType, resultCode?, headers?)</code><td align=right><code><a href="../file/httpreq.h.html">httpreq.h</a>[<a href="../source/httpreq.h.html#313">313</a>]</table><div class=desc>   Start a chunked reply.  This sends the initial headers of a reply   that will be generated in pieces.  This is an alternative to sending   the entire reply as a single string via sendReply(), for situations   where you're generating the reply algorithmically and want to send a   little bit at a time, rather than buffering up the entire reply in a   string or StringBuffer to send all at once.  This is particularly   useful for cases where the reply will take a while to generate,   since it allows the client to interpret partial data before the   entire reply is completed; and for very large reply bodies, where it   would consume a lot of memory to buffer the whole reply. <p>   This routine doesn't send any initial data, but simply begins the   reply process.  For this reason, the content type must be specified:   there's no way for the routine to infer the content type here since   we don't have any body data to look at.  The content type, result   code, and headers arguments work as they do with sendReply(). <p>   After calling this routine, call sendReplyChunk() as many times as   needed to send the pieces of the reply.  After sending all of the   pieces, call endChunkedReply() to finish the reply. <p>
