   SeekAction is designed to handle of commands FIND X, LOOK FOR Y or   SEARCH FOR Z, when they don't seem to be intended as attempts to look   something up in a Consultable. We make it a TopicAction so that it will   match whatever the player types, and so not give away any premature   spoilery information by the nature of the parser's response. <p>   The appropriate response then depends on the player character's state of   knowledge. In the most general case the player is simply given   instructions on how to go about looking for things. This hardly seems   appropriate, however if the object requested is in plain sight, in   which case we point this out to the player. As a courtesy to the   player, we also remind him or her of where an object was last seen, if   it has been seen. <p>   One or two complications need to be dealt with. If the player finds   something like FIND SMELL or FIND NOISE then we should describe it as   having been smelt or heard elsewhere, not seen. We also want to make   sure that the command never matches an Unthing in preference to a   Thing, and that if an Unthing is matched it is not described as being   present.
