   A Question is an interactive question we ask the player via the   regular command line.  The player then has the option to answer the   question, or to ignore the question and enter a new command. <p>   The parser uses Question objects internally to handle certain errors   that the player can fix by entering additional information, such as   disambiguation queries and missing noun phrase queries.  Games can use   Question objects for other, custom interactions. <p>   The basic Question object is incomplete - you have to subclass it to   get a functional question handler.  In particular, you must provide a   parseAnswer() routine that parses the reply and creates a Command to   carry out the action of answering the question.

If this is true, the parser will try   parsing the player's input as an answer to this question BEFORE it   tries parsing the input as a regular command.  If the answer   parses, we'll assume it really is an answer to the question, and   we won't even try parsing it as a new command. <p>   For disambiguation and missing noun queries, the parser only   parses question replies AFTER parsing regular commands.  Replies   to these questions are frequently very short, abbreviated noun   phrases - maybe just a single adjective or noun.  It's fairly   common for there be at least a few nouns that are the same as   verbs in the game, so the input after a disambiguation or missing   noun reply can often be interpreted equally well as a new verb or   as a reply to the question.  There's probably no theoretical basis   for choosing one over the other when this happens, but in practice   it seems that it's usually better to treat the reply as a new   command.  So, by default we set this property to nil, to give   priority to a new command. <p>   Custom questions posed by the game might want to give higher   priority to the answer interpretation, though.  Yes/No questions   in particular will probably want to do this, because otherwise the   parser would take the answer as a conversational overture to any   nearby NPC. <p>

'toks' is the token list of the user's input,   and 'dict' is the main parser Dictionary object. <p>   If the input does look like a valid answer to the question,   returns a CommandList with the parsed reply.  If not, returns nil,   in which case the parser will continue trying to parse the input   as a whole new command. <p>   By default, we simply return nil.  Subclasses/instances must   override this to provide the custom answer parsing. <p>
