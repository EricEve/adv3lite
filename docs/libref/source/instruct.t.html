<a name="7"></a> *   TADS 3 Library: Instructions for new players
<a name="8"></a> *   
<a name="9"></a> *   This module defines the INSTRUCTIONS command, which provides the
<a name="10"></a> *   player with an overview of how to play IF games in general.  These
<a name="11"></a> *   instructions are especially designed as an introduction to IF for
<a name="12"></a> *   inexperienced players.  The instructions given here are meant to be
<a name="13"></a> *   general enough to apply to most games that follow the common IF
<a name="14"></a> *   conventions. 
<a name="15"></a> *   
<a name="16"></a> *   This module defines the English version of the instructions.
<a name="17"></a> *   
<a name="18"></a> *   In most cases, each author should customize these general-purpose
<a name="19"></a> *   instructions at least a little for the specific game.  We provide a
<a name="20"></a> *   few hooks for some specific parameter-driven customizations that don't
<a name="21"></a> *   require modifying the original text in this file.  Authors should also
<a name="22"></a> *   feel free to make more extensive customizations as needed to address
<a name="23"></a> *   areas where the game diverges from the common conventions described
<a name="24"></a> *   here.
<a name="25"></a> *   
<a name="26"></a> *   One of the most important things you should do to customize these
<a name="27"></a> *   instructions for your game is to add a list of any special verbs or
<a name="28"></a> *   command phrasings that your game uses.  Of course, you might think
<a name="29"></a> *   you'll be spoiling part of the challenge for the player if you do
<a name="30"></a> *   this; you might worry that you'll give away a puzzle if you don't keep
<a name="31"></a> *   a certain verb secret.  Be warned, though, that many players - maybe
<a name="32"></a> *   even most - don't think "guess the verb" puzzles are good challenges;
<a name="33"></a> *   a lot of players feel that puzzles that hinge on finding the right
<a name="34"></a> *   verb or phrasing are simply bad design that make a game less
<a name="35"></a> *   enjoyable.  You should think carefully about exactly why you don't
<a name="36"></a> *   want to disclose a particular verb in the instructions.  If you want
<a name="37"></a> *   to withhold a verb because the entire puzzle is to figure out what
<a name="38"></a> *   command to use, then you have created a classic guess-the-verb puzzle,
<a name="39"></a> *   and most everyone in the IF community will feel this is simply a bad
<a name="40"></a> *   puzzle that you should omit from your game.  If you want to withhold a
<a name="41"></a> *   verb because it's too suggestive of a particular solution, then you
<a name="42"></a> *   should at least make sure that a more common verb - one that you are
<a name="43"></a> *   willing to disclose in the instructions, and one that will make as
<a name="44"></a> *   much sense to players as your secret verb - can achieve the same
<a name="45"></a> *   result.  You don't have to disclose every *accepted* verb or phrasing
<a name="46"></a> *   - as long as you disclose every *required* verb *and* phrasing, you
<a name="47"></a> *   will have a defense against accusations of using guess-the-verb
<a name="48"></a> *   puzzles.
<a name="49"></a> *   
<a name="50"></a> *   You might also want to mention the "cruelty" level of the game, so
<a name="51"></a> *   that players will know how frequently they should save the game.  It's
<a name="52"></a> *   helpful to point out whether or not it's possible for the player
<a name="53"></a> *   character to be killed; whether it's possible to get into situations
<a name="54"></a> *   where the game becomes "unwinnable"; and, if the game can become
<a name="55"></a> *   unwinnable, whether or not this will become immediately clear.  The
<a name="56"></a> *   kindest games never kill the PC and are always winnable, no matter
<a name="57"></a> *   what actions the player takes; it's never necessary to save these
<a name="58"></a> *   games except to suspend a session for later resumption.  The cruelest
<a name="59"></a> *   games kill the PC without warning (although if they offer an UNDO
<a name="60"></a> *   command from a "death" prompt, then even this doesn't constitute true
<a name="61"></a> *   cruelty), and can become unwinnable in ways that aren't readily and
<a name="62"></a> *   immediately apparent to the player, which means that the player could
<a name="63"></a> *   proceed for quite some time (and thus invest substantial effort) after
<a name="64"></a> *   the game is already effectively lost.  Note that unwinnable situations
<a name="65"></a> *   can often be very subtle, and might not even be intended by the
<a name="66"></a> *   author; for example, if the player needs a candle to perform an
<a name="67"></a> *   exorcism at some point, but the candle can also be used for
<a name="68"></a> *   illumination in dark areas, the player could make the game unwinnable
<a name="69"></a> *   simply by using up the candle early on while exploring some dark
<a name="70"></a> *   tunnels, and might not discover the problem until much further into
<a name="71"></a> *   the game.

<a name="165"></a>     *   unwinnable at some point, but this won't become apparent to the
<a name="166"></a>     *   player until much later.  For example, suppose the first scene

<a name="173"></a>     *   the game is unwinnable from that point forward.  In order to win,
<a name="174"></a>     *   you have to go back and play almost the whole game over again.
<a name="175"></a>     *   Saved positions are almost useless in a case like this, since
<a name="176"></a>     *   most of the saved positions will be after the fatal mistake; no
<a name="177"></a>     *   matter how often you saved, you'll still have to go back and do

<a name="430"></a>        You&amp;rsquo;ve probably already noticed that you interact with the story
<a name="431"></a>        by typing a command whenever you see the &lt;q&gt;prompt,&lt;/q&gt; which
<a name="432"></a>        usually looks like this:
<a name="433"></a>        \b";
<a name="434"></a>
<a name="435"></a>        "&gt;";
<a name="436"></a>
<a name="437"></a>        "\bKnowing this much, you&amp;rsquo;re probably thinking one of two things:
<a name="438"></a>        &lt;q&gt;Great, I can type absolutely anything I want, in plain English,
<a name="439"></a>        and the story will do my bidding,&lt;/q&gt; or &lt;q&gt;Great, now I have to
<a name="440"></a>        figure out yet another heinously complex command language for
<a name="441"></a>        a computer program; I think I&amp;rsquo;ll go play Minesweeper.&lt;/q&gt;
<a name="442"></a>        Well, neither extreme is quite true.
<a name="443"></a>
<a name="444"></a>        \bIn actual play, you&amp;rsquo;ll only need a fairly small set of
<a name="445"></a>        commands, and the commands are mostly in ordinary English, so
<a name="446"></a>        there&amp;rsquo;s not very much you&amp;rsquo;ll have to learn or remember.
<a name="447"></a>        Even though that command prompt can look intimidating, don&amp;rsquo;t
<a name="448"></a>        let it scare you off &amp;mdash; there are just a few simple things you
<a name="449"></a>        have to know.
<a name="450"></a>
<a name="451"></a>        \bFirst, you&amp;rsquo;ll almost never have to refer to anything that
<a name="452"></a>        isn&amp;rsquo;t directly mentioned in the story; this is a story, after
<a name="453"></a>        all, not a guessing game where you have to think of everything that
<a name="454"></a>        goes together with some random object.  For example, if
<a name="455"></a>        you&amp;rsquo;re wearing a jacket, you might assume that the jacket has
<a name="456"></a>        pockets, or buttons, or a zipper &amp;mdash; but if the story never
<a name="457"></a>        mentions those things, you shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have to worry about them.
<a name="458"></a>
<a name="459"></a>        \bSecond, you won&amp;rsquo;t have to think of every conceivable action
<a name="460"></a>        you could perform.  The point of the game isn&amp;rsquo;t to make you
<a name="461"></a>        guess at verbs.  Instead, you&amp;rsquo;ll only have to use a relatively
<a name="462"></a>        small number of simple, ordinary actions.  To give you an idea
<a name="463"></a>        of what we mean, here are some of the commands you can use:";

<a name="593"></a>        or the like.  (Sometimes a single physical room is so large that
<a name="594"></a>        it comprises several locations in the game, but that&amp;rsquo;s fairly
<a name="595"></a>        rare.)  For the most part, going to a location is as specific
<a name="596"></a>        as you have to get about travel; once your character is in a
<a name="597"></a>        location, the character can usually see and reach everything
<a name="598"></a>        within the location, so you don&amp;rsquo;t have to worry about where
<a name="599"></a>        exactly your character is standing within the room.  Once in
<a name="600"></a>        a while, you might find that something is out of reach, perhaps
<a name="601"></a>        because it&amp;rsquo;s on a high shelf or on the other side of a moat; in
<a name="602"></a>        these cases, it&amp;rsquo;s sometimes useful to be more specific about
<a name="603"></a>        your character&amp;rsquo;s location, such as by standing on something
<a name="604"></a>        (STAND ON TABLE, for example).
<a name="605"></a>
<a name="606"></a>        \bTraveling from one location to another is usually done using
<a name="607"></a>        a direction command: GO NORTH, GO NORTHEAST, GO UP, and so on.
<a name="608"></a>        (You can abbreviate the cardinal and vertical directions to one
<a name="609"></a>        letter each &amp;mdash; N, S, E, W, U, D &amp;mdash; and the diagonal
<a name="610"></a>        directions to two: NE, NW, SE, SW.)  The story should always
<a name="611"></a>        tell you the directions that you can go when it describes a
<a name="612"></a>        location, so you should never have to try all the unmentioned
<a name="613"></a>        directions to see if they go anywhere.
<a name="614"></a>
<a name="615"></a>        \bIn most cases, backtracking (by reversing the direction you
<a name="616"></a>        took from one location to another) will take you back to where you
<a name="617"></a>        started, although some passages might have turns.
<a name="618"></a>
<a name="619"></a>        \bMost of the time, when the story describes a door or passageway,
<a name="620"></a>        you won&amp;rsquo;t need to open the door to go through the passage, as
<a name="621"></a>        the story will do this for you.  Only when the story specifically
<a name="622"></a>        states that a door is blocking your way will you usually have to
<a name="623"></a>        deal with the door explicitly.
<a name="624"></a>        
<a name="625"></a>        
<a name="626"></a>        &lt;&lt;if defined(pcRouteFinder)&gt;&gt;\bAnother way you can travel from place to
<a name="627"></a>        place is by using the command GO TO SOMEWHERE: for example GO TO KITCHEN
<a name="628"></a>        or GO TO GEORGE, where KITCHEN is a room you have already visited or
<a name="629"></a>        GEORGE is someone (or something) you have already seen. This will take
<a name="630"></a>        you on the first step of the way to the kitchen, or to the room where
<a name="631"></a>        you last saw George. To continue on your journey after the first step
<a name="632"></a>        you can use the command CONTINUE, which can be abbreviated to C. You can
<a name="633"></a>        also enter several commands in between, e.g. GO TO KITCHEN, SEARCH DESK,
<a name="634"></a>        TAKE NOTEBOOK, READ NOTEBOOK, CONTINUE.\b
<a name="635"></a>        In some games the player character may start out in a place that&amp;rsquo;s
<a name="636"></a>        already familiar to him or her (e.g. his or her house or home town), in
<a name="637"></a>        which case you may be able to navigate to some locations using GO TO
<a name="638"></a>        without having previously explored that part of the map.

<a name="652"></a>        how your character is supposed to carry or hold something, so you
<a name="653"></a>        shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have to worry about which hand is holding which item
<a name="654"></a>        or anything like that.  It might sometimes be useful to put one
<a name="655"></a>        object inside or on top of another, though; for example, PUT BOOK
<a name="656"></a>        IN SHOPPING BAG or PUT VASE ON TABLE.  If your character&amp;rsquo;s
<a name="657"></a>        hands get full, it might help to put some items being carried
<a name="658"></a>        into a container, much as in real life you can carry more stuff

<a name="874"></a>        \b&lt;b&gt;Using Multiple Objects at Once&lt;/b&gt;
<a name="875"></a>        \bIn most commands, you can operate on multiple objects in
<a name="876"></a>        a single command.  Use the word AND, or a comma, to separate
<a name="877"></a>        one object from another:
<a name="878"></a>
<a name="879"></a>        \b
<a name="880"></a>        \n\t TAKE THE BOX, THE FLOPPY DISK, AND THE ROPE
<a name="881"></a>        \n\t PUT DISK AND ROPE IN BOX
<a name="882"></a>        \n\t DROP BOX AND ROPE
<a name="883"></a>        
<a name="884"></a>        \bYou can use the words ALL and EVERYTHING to refer to everything
<a name="885"></a>        applicable to your command, and you can use EXCEPT or BUT
<a name="886"></a>        (right after the word ALL) to exclude specific objects:
<a name="887"></a>
<a name="888"></a>        \b
<a name="889"></a>        \n\t TAKE ALL
<a name="890"></a>        \n\t PUT ALL BUT DISK AND ROPE INTO BOX
<a name="891"></a>        \n\t TAKE EVERYTHING OUT OF THE BOX
<a name="892"></a>        \n\t TAKE ALL OFF SHELF
<a name="893"></a>
<a name="894"></a>        \bALL refers to everything that makes sense for your command,
<a name="895"></a>        excluding things inside other objects matching the ALL.  For example,
<a name="896"></a>        if you&amp;rsquo;re carrying a box and a rope, and the box contains
<a name="897"></a>        a floppy disk, typing DROP ALL will drop the box and the rope,
<a name="898"></a>        and the floppy will remain in the box.
<a name="899"></a>
<a name="900"></a>        \b&lt;b&gt;&lt;q&gt;It&lt;/q&gt; and &lt;q&gt;Them&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
<a name="901"></a>        \bYou can use IT and THEM to refer to the last object or objects
<a name="902"></a>        that you used in a command:
<a name="903"></a>
<a name="904"></a>        \b
<a name="905"></a>        \n\t TAKE THE BOX
<a name="906"></a>        \n\t OPEN IT
<a name="907"></a>        \n\t TAKE THE DISK AND THE ROPE
<a name="908"></a>        \n\t PUT THEM IN THE BOX
<a name="909"></a>
<a name="910"></a>        \b&lt;b&gt;Multiple Commands At Once&lt;/b&gt;
<a name="911"></a>        \bYou can put multiple commands on a single input line by
<a name="912"></a>        separating the commands with periods or the word THEN, or
<a name="913"></a>        with a comma or AND.  For example:
<a name="914"></a>
<a name="915"></a>        \b
<a name="916"></a>        \n\t TAKE THE DISK AND PUT IT IN THE BOX
<a name="917"></a>        \n\t TAKE BOX. OPEN IT.
<a name="918"></a>        \n\t UNLOCK THE DOOR WITH THE KEY. OPEN IT, THEN GO NORTH.
<a name="919"></a>
<a name="920"></a>        \b If the story doesn&amp;rsquo;t understand one of the commands, it will
<a name="921"></a>        tell you what it couldn&amp;rsquo;t understand, and ignore everything after
<a name="922"></a>        that on the line.";

<a name="927"></a>    {
<a name="928"></a>        "\b&lt;b&gt;A Few Tips&lt;/b&gt;
<a name="929"></a>        \bNow that you know the technical details of entering commands,
<a name="930"></a>        you might be interested in some strategy pointers.  Here are
<a name="931"></a>        a few techniques that experienced interactive fiction players use
<a name="932"></a>        when approaching a story.
<a name="933"></a>
<a name="934"></a>        \bEXAMINE everything, especially when you enter a new location
<a name="935"></a>        for the first time.  Looking at objects will often reveal details
<a name="936"></a>        that aren&amp;rsquo;t mentioned in the broader description of the location.
<a name="937"></a>        If examining an object mentions detailed parts of the object,
<a name="938"></a>        examine them as well.
<a name="939"></a>
<a name="940"></a>        \bMake a map, if the story has more than a few locations.  When
<a name="941"></a>        you encounter a new location for the first time, note all of its
<a name="942"></a>        exits; this will make it easy to see at a glance if there are any
<a name="943"></a>        exits you haven&amp;rsquo;t explored yet.  If you get stuck, you can scan
<a name="944"></a>        your map for any unexplored areas, where you might find what
<a name="945"></a>        you&amp;rsquo;re looking for.
<a name="946"></a>
<a name="947"></a>        \bIf the story doesn&amp;rsquo;t recognize a word or any of its synonyms,
<a name="948"></a>        the object you&amp;rsquo;re trying to manipulate probably isn&amp;rsquo;t
<a name="949"></a>        important to the story.  If you try manipulating something, and the
<a name="950"></a>        story responds with something like &lt;q&gt;that isn&amp;rsquo;t important,&lt;/q&gt;
<a name="951"></a>        you can probably just ignore the object; it&amp;rsquo;s most likely just
<a name="952"></a>        there as scenery, to make the setting more detailed.
<a name="953"></a>
<a name="954"></a>        \bIf you&amp;rsquo;re trying to accomplish something, and nothing you do
<a name="955"></a>        seems to work, pay attention to what&amp;rsquo;s going wrong.  If
<a name="956"></a>        everything you try is met with utter dismissal (&lt;q&gt;nothing
<a name="957"></a>        happens&lt;/q&gt; or &lt;q&gt;that&amp;rsquo;s not something you can open&lt;/q&gt;), you
<a name="958"></a>        might simply be on the wrong track; step back and think about other
<a name="959"></a>        ways of approaching the problem.  If the response is something more
<a name="960"></a>        specific, it might be a clue. &lt;q&gt;The guard says &lt;q&gt;you can&amp;rsquo;t
<a name="961"></a>        open that here!&lt;/q&gt;\ and snatches the box from your hands&lt;/q&gt; &amp;mdash;
<a name="962"></a>        this might indicate that you have to get the guard to leave, or
<a name="963"></a>        that you should take the box somewhere else before you open it,
<a name="964"></a>        for example.
<a name="965"></a>
<a name="966"></a>        \bIf you get completely stuck, you might try setting aside the
<a name="967"></a>        current puzzle and working on a different problem for a while.
<a name="968"></a>        You might even want to save your position and take a break from
<a name="969"></a>        the game.  The solution to the problem that&amp;rsquo;s been
<a name="970"></a>        thwarting your progress might come to you in a flash of insight
<a name="971"></a>        when you least expect it, and those moments of insight can be
<a name="972"></a>        incredibly rewarding.  Some stories are best appreciated when
<a name="973"></a>        played over a period of days, weeks, or even months; if you&amp;rsquo;re
<a name="974"></a>        enjoying the story, why rush through it?
<a name="975"></a>
<a name="976"></a>        \bFinally, if all else fails, you can try asking for help.  A
<a name="977"></a>        great place to go for hints is the Interactive Fiction Community Forum at
<a name="978"></a>        &lt;a href='https://intfiction.org'&gt;https://intfiction.org&lt;/a&gt;. ";
