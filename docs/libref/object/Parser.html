   Parser is the class that implements the main parsing procedure, namely   taking a line of text from the player, figuring out what it means, and   executing it. <p>   The conventional IF parsing loop simply consists of reading a line of   text from the player, calling Parser.parse() on the string, and   repeating. <p>   In most cases you'll just need a single Parser instance.  The Parser   object keeps track of unfinished commands, such as when we need to ask   for disambiguation help or for a missing object.  If for some reason   you want to keep multiple sets of this kind of state (reading input   from more than one player, for example), you can create as many Parser   instances as needed.

<table class=decl><tr><td><code>autoLook</code><td align=right><code><a href="../file/parser.t.html">parser.t</a>[<a href="../source/parser.t.html#95">95</a>]</table><div class=desc>   Auto-Look: Should we treat an empty command line (i.e., the user   just presses Return) as a LOOK AROUND command? <p>   The traditional handling since the Infocom era has always been to   treat an empty command line as a parsing error, and display an   error message along the lines of "I beg your pardon?".  Given that   an empty command line has no conflicting meaning, though, we   *could* assign it a meaning. <p>   But what meaning should that be?  A blank line is the simplest   possible command for a player to enter, so it would make sense to   define it as some very commonly used command.  It's also fairly   easy to enter a blank line accidentally (which is partly why the   traditional reply is an error message), so the command should be   benign - it shouldn't be a problem to enter it unintentionally.   It can't be anything with parallel verbs, like NORTH, since then   there'd be no good reason to pick NORTH instead of, say, SOUTH.   Finally, it has to be intransitive, since it obviously won't   involve an object name.  The obvious candidates that fit all of   these criteria are LOOK and INVENTORY.  LOOK is probably the more   useful and the more frequently used of the two, so it's the one we   choose by default. <p>   If this property is set to true, we'll perform a LOOK AROUND   command when the player enters a blank command line.  If nil,   we'll show an error message. <p>

<a name="autoSpell"></a>
<table class=decl><tr><td><code>autoSpell</code><td align=right><code><a href="../file/parser.t.html">parser.t</a>[<a href="../source/parser.t.html#132">132</a>]</table><div class=desc>   Should we attempt automatic spelling correction?  If this is true, whenever a command   fails, we'll check for a word that we don't recognize; if we find one, we'll try applying   spelling correction to see if we can come up with a working command. <p>   Our spelling correction algorithm is designed to be quite conservative.  In particular, we   generally limit candidates for "correct" words to the vocabulary for objects that are   actually in scope, which avoids revealing the existence of objects that haven't been seen   yet; and we only apply a correction when it yields a command that parses and resolves   correctly.  When we can't correct a command and get something resolvable, we don't even   mention that we tried.  This avoids the bizarre, random guesses at "corrections" that often   show up in other applications, and more importantly avoids giving away information that the   player shouldn't know yet. <p>   We set this to true by default, in an attempt to reduce the player's typing workload by   automatically correcting simple typos when possible.  If for some reason the spelling   corrector is problematic in a particular game, you can disable it by setting this property   to nil. <p>   As an experiment, change the default value to be nil when we're in a conversation and true   otherwise, since over-zealous spelling corrections can be particularly troublesome in a   conversational context. <p>

The precise meaning of the default action varies by object.  For most   objects, it's EXAMINE.  For locations, it's GO TO. <p>   We make the default value nil since setting it to true can result in   some rather odd parser behaviour. <p>

When we ask an interactive   question (such as a disambiguation query, a missing noun phrase   query, or a custom question from the game), this is set to the   Question waiting to be answered.

<a name="showUnknownWords"></a>
<table class=decl><tr><td><code>showUnknownWords</code><td align=right><code><a href="../file/parser.t.html">parser.t</a>[<a href="../source/parser.t.html#199">199</a>]</table><div class=desc>   When the parser doesn't recognize a word, should it say so?  If   this property is set to true, when parsing fails, we'll scan the   command line for a word that's not in the dictionary and show a   message such as "I don't know the word &lt;foo&gt;."  If this property   is nil, the parser will instead simply say that it doesn't   recognize the syntax, or that the object in question isn't   present, without saying specifically which word wasn't recognized,   or indeed even admitting that there was such a thing. <p>   There are two schools of thought on this, both concerned with   optimizing the user experience. <p>   The first school holds that the parser's job is to be as helpful   as possible.  First and foremost, that means we should understand   the user's input as often as possible.  But when we can't, it   means that we should be do our best to explain what we didn't   understand, to help the user formulate a working command next   time.  In the case of a word the parser doesn't recognize, we can   be pretty sure that the unknown word is the reason we can't   understand the input.  The best way to help the user correct the   problem is to let them know exactly which word we didn't know,   rather than make them guess at what we didn't understand.  This is   the way the classic Infocom games worked, and it's the traditional   TADS default as well. <p>   The second school holds that the user's overriding interest is   maintaining suspension of disbelief, and that the parser should do   its best not to interfere with that.  A major aspect of this in IF   the illusion that the game world is as boundless as the real   world.  Missing dictionary words tend to break this illusion: if   the user types EXAMINE ZEBRA, and the parser replies that it   doesn't know the word "zebra", we've suddenly exposed a limit of   the game world.  If we instead play coy and simply say that   there's no zebra currently present, we allow the player to imagine   that a zebra might yet turn up.  This is the way Inform games   typically work. <p>   Each approach has its advantages and disadvantages, adherents and   detractors, and it seems that neither one is objectively "right".   It comes down to taste.  But there seems to be a clear preference   among the majority of players in the modern era for the second   approach.  The key factor is probably that typical IF commands are   so short that it's easy enough to spot a typo without help from   the parser, so the clarity benefits of "unknown word" messages   seem considerably outweighed by the harm they do to the illusion   of boundlessness.  So, our default is the second option, playing   coy. <p>

<a name="spellTimeLimit"></a>
<table class=decl><tr><td><code>spellTimeLimit</code><td align=right><code><a href="../file/parser.t.html">parser.t</a>[<a href="../source/parser.t.html#148">148</a>]</table><div class=desc>   Maximum spelling correction time, in milliseconds.  The spelling   correction process is iterative, and each iteration involves a new   parsing attempt.  On a fast machine this doesn't tend to be   noticeable, but it's conceivable that a pathological case could   involve a large number of attempts that could be noticeably slow   on an older machine.  To avoid stalling the game while we   overanalyze the spelling possibilities, we set an upper bound to   the actual elapsed time for spelling correction.  Each time we   consider a new correction candidate, we'll check the elapsed time,   and abort the process if it exceeds this limit.  Note that this   limit doesn't limit the parsing time itself - we'll never   interrupt that mid-stream. <p>
