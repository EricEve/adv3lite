   A Doer is a command handler for a specific action acting on particular   objects under a given set of conditions.  We use these for all of the   levels of customization in command handling. <p>   Doer objects are inherently static.  All Doer objects should be   defined at compile time; they're not designed to be created   dynamically during execution.  Rather than creating and removing Doer   objects as conditions in the game change, use the Doer conditions to   define when a given Doer is active and when it's dormant.

This is a string describing   the action and object combination that this handler recognizes. <p>   The command string specifies a verb and its objects, generally   using the same verb phrase syntax that a player would use to enter   a command to the game.  The exact verb syntax is up to the   language library to define; for English, we replicate the same   verb phrases used to parse command input. <p>   The verb phrase syntax is generally the same as for regular player   commands, but the noun syntax is different.  Each noun is written   as the SOURCE CODE name of a game object or class.  That is, not a   noun-and-adjective phrase as the player would type it, but the   program symbol name as it appears in the source code.  If you use   a class name, the command matches any object of the class.  For   example, to handle putting any treasure in any container: <p> <br>   cmd = 'put Treasure in Container' <p>   You can match multiple objects or classes in a single noun slot   (and you can freely mix objects and classes).  For example, to   handle putting any treasure or magic item in a container: <p> <br>   cmd = 'put Treasure|Magical in Container' <p>   You can't use the '|' syntax with verbs, because the verb syntax   covers the entire phrase.  You can match multiple verbs by writing   out the entire phrasing for each verb, separating each phrase with   a semicolon: <p> <br>   cmd = 'take skull; put skull in Thing' <p>   You can also write a command that matches ANY verb, by using "*"   as the verb.  You can follow the "*" with any number of objects;   the first is the direct object, the second is the indirect, and   the third is the accessory.  This phrasing will match any verb   that matches the given objects AND the given number of objects.   For example, '* Thing' will match any verb with a direct object   that's of class Thing, but it won't match verbs without any   objects or verbs with an indirect object.  Using "*" as a noun   will match any object as well as no object at all.  So to write a   handler for every possible command, you'd write: <p> <br>   cmd = '* * * *' <p>   That is, match any verb, with or without any direct object,   indirect object, and accessory object. <p>

You can use this when it's   necessary to override the default precedence order, which is   figured according to the specialization rules described below. <p>   Most of the time, you shouldn't need to set a priority manually.   If you don't, the library determines the precedence automatically   according to the degree of specialization.  However, the way the   library figures specialization is a heuristic, so it's not always   right.  In cases where the heuristic produces the wrong results,   you can bypass the rules by setting a priority manually.  A manual   priority takes precedence over all of the standard rules. <p>   Our basic approach is to process Doers in order from most specific   to most general.  This creates a natural hierarchy of handlers   where more specific rules override the generic, default handlers.   Here are the degrees of specialization, in order of importance: <p>   1. A Doer with a higher 'priority' value takes precedence over one   with a lower value. <p>   2. A Doer with a 'when' condition is more specific than a Doer   without one.  A 'when' condition means that the Doer is designed   to operate only at specific times, so it's inherently more   specialized than one that always operates. <p>   3. A Doer with a 'where' condition is more specific than a Doer   without one.  A 'where' condition means that the Doer only applies   to a limited geographical area. <p>   4. A Doer that matches a particular Action is more specific than   one that matches any Action. <p>   5. If two Doer commands are for the same Action, the Doer that   matches a more specialized subclass (or just a single object   instance) for a noun phrase is more specific than one that matches   a base class for the same noun phrase.  For example, 'take   Container' is more specific than 'take Thing', because Container   is a subclass of Thing, and 'take backpack' (where the 'backpack'   is a Container) is more specific than either.  This type of   specialization applies in the canonical object role order: direct   object, indirect object, accessory.  For example, we consider 'put   Container in Thing' to be more specific than 'put Thing in   Container', because we look at the direct object by itself before   we even consider the indirect object.  This rule only applies when   the Action is the same: 'put Thing in Container' and 'open Door'   are equal for the purposes of this rule. <p>   It's important to understand that each degree of specialization is   considered independently of the others, in the order above.  For   example, if you have a Doer with just a 'when' condition, and   another with only a 'where' condition, the one with the 'when'   condition has higher priority.  This is because we look at the   presence of a 'when' condition first, before even considering   whether there's a 'where' condition. <p>   The library has no way to gauge the specificity of a 'when' or   'where' condition, so there's no finer-grained priority to the   conditions than simply their presence or absence. <p>   If two Doers have the same priority based on the rules above, the   one that's defined LATER in the source code has priority.  This   means that Doers defined in the game take priority over library   definitions. <p>
