   HTTP Server Object.  This implements a multi-threaded, background server   that runs concurrently with the game program.  The server listens for   and accepts incoming connection requests from clients, and then handles   HTTP protocol transactions with connected clients.  Client requests are   routed to the byte code program via network events, which the program   can retrieve via the getNetEvent() function. <p>   Construction: to set up an HTTP server, simply create an HTTPServer   object with 'new': <p> <br>    local srv = new HTTPServer(hostname, portnum?, maxUploadSize?); <p>   'hostname' is a string giving the domain name or IP address that the   server will bind to for accepting connections.  For a server that   accepts connections from separate client machines, this is simply the   external IP address of the local machine.  (This is specified as an   argument because some machines have more than one network interface, and   thus have more than one IP address or domain name.) <p>   'portnum' is the TCP/IP port number wehre the server will listen for   incoming connections.  If this is omitted or nil, the operating system   will automatically select an available port number and assign it to the   server.  Using a specific port number allows you to create a service on   a "well known" port, which makes it easier for clients to find the   service; but a given port can only be used by one server at a time, so   using a pre-selected port number runs the risk that some other process   will already be using the same port. <p>   'maxUploadSize' is the maximum size in bytes for any single request's   content.  Content sizes over this limit will be rejected.  Some HTTP   requests, such as POST, can include uploaded content from the client,   and the HTTP protocol itself supports essentially unlimited sizes for   these objects.  Uploads consume resources on the server, though, so it's   often desirable to set a size limit to prevent errant or malicious   clients from overwhelming the server with a very large upload.   Depending on the specific function of your server, you might or might   not wish to set a limit.  If you omit this argument or set it to nil,   unlimited upload sizes will be allowed.  Note that this limit applies to   each individual upload separately; it's not a lifetime limit for the   server or for any session. <p>   Creating an HTTPServer object with 'new' automatically starts the   server.  The object will create a background thread that will listen for   incoming connections on the given network address and port number, so   the server is active as soon as the 'new' finishes.  You can create any   number of servers, as long as they have different port numbers.  When a   connection request is received, the server will accept the connection   and automatically create another background thread to handle requests on   that connection.  Each incoming request will be forwarded to the game   program to handle, via the network message queue.

This returns a string giving the   original binding address specified when the object was constructed.

This returns an integer giving the TCP/IP   network port number on which this server is listening for incoming   connections.  Clients connect to the port by including it in the   HTTP URL, after the host name.  For example, if the server is on   port 10815, the client would connect to a URL of the form   http://myserver.com:10815/index.htm. <p>
</div>
<a name="shutdown"></a>
<table class=decl><tr><td><code>shutdown (wait?)</code><td align=right><code><a href="../file/httpsrv.h.html">httpsrv.h</a>[<a href="../source/httpsrv.h.html#112">112</a>]</table><div class=desc>   Shut down the server.  This immediately disconnects the server from   its network port; no further client connections will be accepted   once the server shuts down.  In addition, all of the server threads   that were started by this server object will be notified to   terminate. <p>   If 'wait' is omitted or is nil, the routine sends the shutdown   notification to the main server and to its server threads, then   immediately returns.  This means that one or more of the server's   background threads might continue to run for a while after   shutdown() returns.  The main practical consideration is that the   port number used by the server might not be immediately available   for use by a new server object, since the port won't be closed until   the server actually exits. <p>   If 'wait' is true, this routine won't return until all of the server   threads have actually terminated. <p>   The return value is true if all server threads have terminated, nil   if any server threads are still running.  It's legal to call this   routine repeatedly, so you can make repeated calls to shutdown(nil)   to poll for completion.  This is useful if you need to wait until   the server shuts down to move on to a next step, but you have other   work you can perform in the meantime.  If you don't have any other   work, you can avoid burning CPU time by calling shutdown(true),   which waits (without consuming CPU time) for the server to exit. <p>
