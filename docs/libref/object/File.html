   The File intrinsic class provides access to files in the external file   system.  This lets you create, read, and write files.  The class   supports text files (with translations to and from local character   sets), "data" files (using the special TADS 2 binary file format), and   "raw" files (this mode lets you manipulate files in arbitrary text or   binary formats by giving you direct access to the raw bytes in the   file).

<table class=decl><tr><td><code>closeFile ( )</code><td align=right><code><a href="../file/file.h.html">file.h</a>[<a href="../source/file.h.html#292">292</a>]</table><div class=desc>   Close the file.  Flushes any buffered information to the underlying   system file and releases any system resources (such as share locks   or system buffers) associated with the file.  After this routine is   called, no further operations on the file can be performed (a   FileClosedException will be thrown if any subsequent operations are   attempted). <p>   If the game is running in web server mode, the file might be on a   remote storage server.  In this case, if the file was opened with   write access, closing it will send the file to the storage server. <p>   Note that this method can throw an error, so you shouldn't consider   updates to the file to be "safe" until this method returns   successfully.  On many systems, writes are buffered in memory, so   closing the file can involve flushing buffers, which can trigger the   same sorts of errors that can happen with ordinary writes (running   out of disk space, physical media defects, etc).  In addition, when   the file is on a remote network storage server, closing a file   opened with write access transmits the file to the storage server,   which can encounter network errors. <p>   You should always explicitly close files when done with them.  This   is especially important when writing to a file, because many systems   buffer written data in memory and don't write changes to the   physical media until the file is closed.  This means that updates   can be lost if the program crashes (or the computer loses power,   etc) while the file is still open.  Closing the file as soon as   you're done with it reduces the chances of this kind of data loss.   It also helps overall system performance to release resources back   to the operating system as soon as you're done with them. <p>   If you *don't* close a file, though, the system will close it   automatically when the File object becomes unreachable and is   deleted by the garbage collector.  It's considered bad form to   depend on this for the reasons above, and it's also problematic   because you won't have any way of finding out if an error should   happen on close. <p>

<a name="digestMD5"></a>
<table class=decl><tr><td><code>digestMD5 (length?)</code><td align=right><code><a href="../file/file.h.html">file.h</a>[<a href="../source/file.h.html#563">563</a>]</table><div class=desc>   Calculate the MD5 digest of bytes read from the file, starting at   the current seek location and continuing for the given number of   bytes.  If the length is omitted, the whole rest of the file is   digested.  This has the side effect of reading the given number of   bytes from the file, so it leaves the seek position set to the next   byte after the bytes digested. <p>   Returns a string of 32 hex digits giving the digest result. <p>   This can only be used on files opened in raw mode with read access. <p>
</div>
<a name="getCharacterSet"></a>
<table class=decl><tr><td><code>getCharacterSet ( )</code><td align=right><code><a href="../file/file.h.html">file.h</a>[<a href="../source/file.h.html#241">241</a>]</table><div class=desc>   get the CharacterSet object the File is currently using; returns   nil for a non-text file <p>

<table class=decl><tr><td><code>getFileMode ( )</code><td align=right><code><a href="../file/file.h.html">file.h</a>[<a href="../source/file.h.html#458">458</a>]</table><div class=desc>   Get the file mode.  This returns one of the FileModeXxx constants,   indicating the mode used to open the file (text, data, raw). <p>

<table class=decl><tr><td><code>getFileSize ( )</code><td align=right><code><a href="../file/file.h.html">file.h</a>[<a href="../source/file.h.html#452">452</a>]</table><div class=desc>get the size in bytes of the file<p>

<table class=decl><tr><td><code>getPos ( )</code><td align=right><code><a href="../file/file.h.html">file.h</a>[<a href="../source/file.h.html#396">396</a>]</table><div class=desc>   Get the current read/write position in the file.  Returns the byte   offset in the file of the next byte to be read or written.  Note   that this value is an offset, so 0 is the offset of the first byte   in the file. <p>
</div>
<a name="packBytes"></a>
<table class=decl><tr><td><code>packBytes (format, ...)</code><td align=right><code><a href="../file/file.h.html">file.h</a>[<a href="../source/file.h.html#522">522</a>]</table><div class=desc>   Pack the given data values into bytes according to a format   definition string, and write the packed bytes to the file.  This   function is designed to simplify writing files that use structured   binary formats defined by third parties, such as JPEG or PDF.  The   function translates native TADS data values into selected binary   formats, and writes the resulting bytes to the file, all in a single   operation. <p>   'format' is the format string, and the remaining arguments are the   values to be packed. <p>   Returns the number of bytes written to the file.  (More precisely,   returns the final file position as a byte offset from the starting   file pointer.  If a positioning code like @ or X is used in the   string, it's possible that more bytes were actually written.) <p>   See Byte Packing in the System Manual for details. <p>
</div>
<a name="readBytes"></a>
<table class=decl><tr><td><code>readBytes (byteArr, start?, cnt?)</code><td align=right><code><a href="../file/file.h.html">file.h</a>[<a href="../source/file.h.html#365">365</a>]</table><div class=desc>   Read bytes from the file into the given ByteArray object.  This can   only be used for a file opened in 'raw' mode.  If 'start' and 'cnt'   are given, they give the starting index in the byte array at which   the bytes read are to be stored, and the number of bytes to read,   respectively; if these are omitted, one byte is read from the file   for each byte in the byte array. <p>   Returns the number of bytes actually read into the byte array,   which will be less than or equal to the number requested.  If the   number read is less than the number requested, it means that the   end of the file was encountered, and only the returned number of   bytes were available. <p>
</div>
<a name="readFile"></a>
<table class=decl><tr><td><code>readFile ( )</code><td align=right><code><a href="../file/file.h.html">file.h</a>[<a href="../source/file.h.html#322">322</a>]</table><div class=desc>   Read from the file.  Returns a data value that depends on the file   mode, as described below, or nil at end of file. <p>   If the file is open in text mode, this reads a line of text from the   file and returns a string with the text of the line read.  A line of   text is a sequence of characters terminated with a line-ending   sequence, which is a carriage return, line feed, CR/LF pair, LF/CR   pair, or a Unicode line terminator character (0x2028) if the file is   being read with one of the Unicode encodings.  If the line read ends   in a line-ending sequence, the returned text will end in a '\n'   character, regardless of which of the possible line-ending sequences   is actually in the file, so the caller need not worry about the   details of the external file's format.  Every line read from the   file will end in a '\n' except possibly the last line - if the file   doesn't end with a line-ending sequence, then the last line read   from the file won't end in a '\n' character.  All bytes read from   the file will be mapped to characters through the CharacterSet   object currently in effect in the file, so the returned string will   always be a standard Unicode string, regardless of the byte encoding   of the file. <p>   If the file is open in 'data' mode, this reads one data element   using the private tads-specific data format.  The result is a value   of one of the types writable with writeFile() in 'data' mode.  In   order to read a 'data' file, the file must have been previously   written in 'data' mode. <p>
</div>
<a name="setCharacterSet"></a>
<table class=decl><tr><td><code>setCharacterSet (charset)</code><td align=right><code><a href="../file/file.h.html">file.h</a>[<a href="../source/file.h.html#251">251</a>]</table><div class=desc>   Set the CharacterSet object the File is to use from now on.  This   isn't meaningful except for text files.  'charset' can be a   CharacterSet object, a string giving the name of a character mapping   (in which case a CharacterSet object is automatically created based   on the name), or nil (in which case the local system's default   character set for text files is used). <p>
</div>
<a name="setFileMode"></a>
<table class=decl><tr><td><code>setFileMode (mode, charset?)</code><td align=right><code><a href="../file/file.h.html">file.h</a>[<a href="../source/file.h.html#501">501</a>]</table><div class=desc>   Change the file mode.  'mode' is a FileModeXxx value giving the   desired new file mode. <p>   If the mode is FileModeText, 'charset' is the character set mapping   to use for the file; this can be given as a CharacterSet object, or   as a string giving the name of a character set.  If the value is nil   or the argument is omitted, the local system's default character for   file contents is used.  The 'charset' parameter is ignored for other   modes. <p>
</div>
<a name="setPos"></a>
<table class=decl><tr><td><code>setPos (pos)</code><td align=right><code><a href="../file/file.h.html">file.h</a>[<a href="../source/file.h.html#416">416</a>]</table><div class=desc>   Set the current read/write position in the file.  'pos' is a byte   offset in the file; 0 is the offset of the first byte. <p>   For files in 'text' and 'data' modes, a caller should NEVER set the   file position to any value other than a value previously returned   by getPos(), because other positions might violate the format   constraints.  For example, if you move the file position to a byte   in the middle of a line-ending sequence in a text file, subsequent   reading from the file might misinterpret the sequence as something   other than a line ending, or as an extra line ending.  If you move   the position in a 'data' file to a byte in the middle of an integer   value, reading from the file would misinterpret as a data type tag   a byte that is part of the integer value instead.  So it is never   meaningful or safe to set an arbitrary byte offset in these file   formats; only values known to be valid by virtue of having been   returned from getPos() can be used here in these modes. <p>
</div>
<a name="setPosEnd"></a>
<table class=decl><tr><td><code>setPosEnd ( )</code><td align=right><code><a href="../file/file.h.html">file.h</a>[<a href="../source/file.h.html#425">425</a>]</table><div class=desc>   Set the current read/write position to the end of the file.  This   can be used, for example, to open a 'data' mode file for   read/write/keep access (keeping the contents of an existing file)   and then adding more data after all of the existing data in the   file. <p>
</div>
<a name="sha256"></a>
<table class=decl><tr><td><code>sha256 (length?)</code><td align=right><code><a href="../file/file.h.html">file.h</a>[<a href="../source/file.h.html#549">549</a>]</table><div class=desc>   Calculate the 256-bit SHA-2 hash of bytes read from the file,   starting at the current seek location and continuing for the given   number of bytes.  If the length is omitted, the whole rest of the   file is hashed.  This has the side effect of reading the given   number of bytes from the file, so it leaves the seek position set to   the next byte after the bytes hashed. <p>   Returns a string of 64 hex digits giving the hash result. <p>   This can only be used on files opened in raw mode with read access. <p>
</div>
<a name="unpackBytes"></a>
<table class=decl><tr><td><code>unpackBytes (format)</code><td align=right><code><a href="../file/file.h.html">file.h</a>[<a href="../source/file.h.html#535">535</a>]</table><div class=desc>   Read bytes and unpack into a data structure, according to the format   description string 'desc'. <p>   'format' is the format string.  The function reads bytes from the   current location in the file and translates them into data values   according to the format string, returning a list of the unpacked   values. <p>   Refer to Byte Packing in the System Manual for details. <p>
</div>
<a name="writeBytes"></a>
<table class=decl><tr><td><code>writeBytes (source, start?, cnt?)</code><td align=right><code><a href="../file/file.h.html">file.h</a>[<a href="../source/file.h.html#388">388</a>]</table><div class=desc>   Write bytes from the given source object into the file.  This can   only be used for a file opened in 'raw' mode. <p>   The source object must be one of the following object types: <p>   File: the contents of the given source file are copied to 'self'.   'start' is the starting seek position in the source file; if   omitted, the current seek position is the default.  'cnt' is the   number of bytes to copy; if omitted, the file is copied from the   given starting position to the end of the file. <p>   ByteArray: the bytes of the byte array are copied to the file.   'start' is the starting index in the byte array; if omitted, the   default is the first byte (index 1).  'cnt' is the number of bytes   to copy; if omitted, bytes are copied from the start position to the   end of the array. <p>   No return value; if an error occurs writing the data, a   FileIOException is thrown. <p>
</div>
<a name="writeFile"></a>
<table class=decl><tr><td><code>writeFile (val)</code><td align=right><code><a href="../file/file.h.html">file.h</a>[<a href="../source/file.h.html#349">349</a>]</table><div class=desc>   Write to the file.  Writes the given value to the file in a format   that depends on the file mode, as described below.  No return   value; if an error occurs writing the data, this throws a   FileIOException. <p>   If the file is open in text mode, this writes text to the file,   converting the given value to a string if necessary (and throwing   an error if such a conversion isn't possible), and translating the   string to be written to bytes by mapping the string through the   CharacterSet object currently in effect for the file.  Note that no   line-ending characters are automatically added to the output, so if   the caller wishes to write line terminators, it should simply   include a '\n' character at the end of each line. <p>   If the file is open in 'data' mode, this writes the value, which   must be a string, integer, enum, or 'true' value, in a private   tads-specific data format that can later be read using the same   format.  The values are converted to the private binary format,   which is portable across platforms: a file written in 'data' mode   on one machine can be copied (byte-for-byte) to another machine,   even one that uses different hardware and a different operating   system, and read back in 'data' mode on the new machine to yield   the original values written. <p>
