   A FileName represents the name of a file in the local operating   system.  The File object methods that take filename specifications   accept FileName objects as well as ordinary strings. <p>   It's easier to write portable code if you manipulate filenames using   the FileName class rather than using ordinary strings.  TADS runs on   several different operating systems with differing syntax rules for   constructing file names and directory paths.  The FileName class   handles the different rules that apply on each system. <p>   Construction: <p> <br>   new FileName() - creates a FileName object representing the working <br>           directory (e.g., '.' on Unix or Windows) <p> <br>   new FileName(str) - creates a FileName from a string 'str' giving a <br>           file path in local filename syntax. <p> <br>   new FileName(path, name) - creates a FileName from a path and <br>           a file name.  'path' and 'name' can each be a FileName <br>           object or a string using local filename syntax.  The <br>           new object represents the combined path <p> <br>   new FileName(specialID) - creates a FileName from one of the special <br>           file identifiers defined in file.h. <p>   You can also use the fromUniversal() static method, which creates a   FileName from a path in universal (URL-style) notation. <p>   String conversions: using a FileName object in a context where a   string is required (such as displaying it) automatically converts the   object to a string giving the local file name path. <p>   Operators: <p> <br>   FileName + string  =&gt; yields a new FileName object combining <br>           the path given by FileName and the string naming a file, <br>           in local naming conventions. <p> <br>   FileName + FileName  =&gt; yields a new FileName object combining <br>           the two names, treating the first as a directory path. <p> <br>   FileName == string (or !=) OR <br>   FileName == FileName <br>           Compares the FileName to the string or other filename path. <br>           This does a superficial comparison of the path contents, <br>           without attempting to correlate the path to the actual file <br>           system layout.  For example, it doesn't resolve symbolic <br>           links on Unix or apply working directories to local paths.

<table class=decl><tr><td><code>addToPath (element)</code><td align=right><code><a href="../file/filename.h.html">filename.h</a>[<a href="../source/filename.h.html#127">127</a>]</table><div class=desc>   Add a path element (a string or FileName object) to the end of   this filename, yielding a new FileName object with the combined   path.  Uses the correct local syntax to combine the path elements.   This yields the same results as FileName + element. <p>   The new FileName object is in canonical form, meaning that any   internal relative path elements (e.g., Unix "." and "..") are   processed by combining them with adjacent elements as appropriate.   For example, adding ".." to the Unix path "a/b/c" yields "a/b". <p>
</div>
<a name="createDirectory"></a>
<table class=decl><tr><td><code>createDirectory (createParents?)</code><td align=right><code><a href="../file/filename.h.html">filename.h</a>[<a href="../source/filename.h.html#285">285</a>]</table><div class=desc>   Create a directory with the name contained in this object.  The   file safety settings must allow write access to the parent folder. <p>   If 'createParents' is specified, it's a true or nil value   specifying whether or not to create intermediate parent   directories.  The default is nil if it's omitted.  If it's true,   and 'dirname' contains multiple path elements, any parents of the   named directory that don't already exist will be created as well.   For example, on Linux, if dirname is '/a/b/c', and directory '/a'   exists but not '/a/b', the routine will first create '/a/b' and   then create '/a/b/c'. <p>
</div>
<a name="deleteFile"></a>
<table class=decl><tr><td><code>deleteFile ( )</code><td align=right><code><a href="../file/filename.h.html">filename.h</a>[<a href="../source/filename.h.html#228">228</a>]</table><div class=desc>   Delete the disk file named by this object.  The file safety level   must allow write access to the file; a file safety exception is   thrown if not. <p>
</div>
<a name="forEachFile"></a>
<table class=decl><tr><td><code>forEachFile (func, recursive?)</code><td align=right><code><a href="../file/filename.h.html">filename.h</a>[<a href="../source/filename.h.html#270">270</a>]</table><div class=desc>   Invoke a callback for each file in the directory named by this   object.  'func' is a callback function; for each file in the   directory, this is invoked as func(f), where 'f' is a FileName   object describing the file.  If 'recursive' is true, the method   recursively scans the contents of subdirectories; if 'recursive'   is nil or is omitted, only the direct contents of the directory   are scanned. <p>
</div>
<a name="getAbsolutePath"></a>
<table class=decl><tr><td><code>getAbsolutePath ( )</code><td align=right><code><a href="../file/filename.h.html">filename.h</a>[<a href="../source/filename.h.html#156">156</a>]</table><div class=desc>   Get a FileName giving the absolute path to this file.  This   applies the current working directory and/or volume (e.g., drive   letter on Windows) to produce the full path in absolute notation,   using the appropriate syntax for the local operating system.  If   the name is already in absolute format, the result will usually be   unchanged, although the exact syntax might be modified on some   systems to change the name to a more canonical format. <p>   If it's not possible to convert the filename into an absolute   path, returns nil. <p>
</div>
<a name="getBaseName"></a>
<table class=decl><tr><td><code>getBaseName ( )</code><td align=right><code><a href="../file/filename.h.html">filename.h</a>[<a href="../source/filename.h.html#90">90</a>]</table><div class=desc>   Get the base filename portion, without the path.  This returns a   string giving the filename without any directory location   information; for a Unix-style path or Windows-style path, this is   simply the last element of the path. <p>
</div>
<a name="getFileInfo"></a>
<table class=decl><tr><td><code>getFileInfo (followLinks?)</code><td align=right><code><a href="../file/filename.h.html">filename.h</a>[<a href="../source/filename.h.html#221">221</a>]</table><div class=desc>   Get extended information on the file named by this object.  This   retrieves the size of the file, timestamps, and the file's type,   and returns the information as a FileInfo object (see file.t).  If   the file doesn't exist, or can't be accessed for some other reason   at the operating system level, returns nil. <p>   'asLink' has the same meaning as in getFileType(), and has no   effect at all unless the file named is a symbolic link. <p>   The file safety settings must allow read access to the file. <p>
</div>
<a name="getFileType"></a>
<table class=decl><tr><td><code>getFileType (followLinks?)</code><td align=right><code><a href="../file/filename.h.html">filename.h</a>[<a href="../source/filename.h.html#207">207</a>]</table><div class=desc>   Get the type of the file.  If the file named by this object exists,   returns an integer with a bitwise combination of FileTypeXxx values   indicating the type of the file.  If the file doesn't exist, or   can't be accessed due to file system permissions or some other   operating system error, the return value is nil.  Note that it's   also possible for the return value to be zero, which means   something different from nil: zero means that the file exists, but   it doesn't fit any of the FileTypeXxx classifications. <p>   If the file is a symbolic link, the method's behavior depends on   'asLink'.  A symbolic link is a special type of file supported on   some operating systems that serves as a pointer or proxy for   another file.  If the file is a link, and 'asLink' is omitted or   nil, the method returns information on the target of the link; this   is the default because symbolic links in generally act as   transparent proxies for their targets, so for most purposes a   caller should be interested in the target file's metadata.   However, a symbolic link also has a separate identity of its own as   a link, so callers might sometimes be interested in the metadata   for the link rather than its target.  To get information on the   link itself, set 'asLink' to true.  'asLink' has no effect for   ordinary non-link files, and also has no effect for "hard" links on   systems that support those as well. <p>   Most of the FileTypeXxx bits are mutually exclusive, but it's   possible that more than one bit will be set, so test using '&amp;'   (e.g., (f.getFileType() &amp; FileTypeDir)). <p>   The file safety settings must allow read access to the file. <p>
</div>
<a name="getName"></a>
<table class=decl><tr><td><code>getName ( )</code><td align=right><code><a href="../file/filename.h.html">filename.h</a>[<a href="../source/filename.h.html#82">82</a>]</table><div class=desc>   Get the filename.  This returns a string with the filename this   object represents, in the local syntax used by the host operating   system, including the path and base filename portions.  (This is   the same string returned for toString(self), and the same string   used if the filename is displayed as though it were a string, such   as with "&lt;&lt; &gt;&gt;".) <p>
</div>
<a name="getPath"></a>
<table class=decl><tr><td><code>getPath ( )</code><td align=right><code><a href="../file/filename.h.html">filename.h</a>[<a href="../source/filename.h.html#99">99</a>]</table><div class=desc>   Get the path portion name, without the file name.  This returns a   FileName object containing the path portion of the file name, with   the last path element removed.  If the path only contains one path   element (so it contains only a file name, not a directory path),   this returns nil. <p>
</div>
<a name="isAbsolute"></a>
<table class=decl><tr><td><code>isAbsolute ( )</code><td align=right><code><a href="../file/filename.h.html">filename.h</a>[<a href="../source/filename.h.html#142">142</a>]</table><div class=desc>   Is this an absolute path on the local system?  An absolute path is   one that contains a root folder specification, such as a Unix path   starting with "/", Windows path starting with "C:\", or a Windows   UNC name such as "\\SERVER\SHARE". <p>   Note that a Windows path can start with a drive letter without   being absolute, as in "C:path\file" (that's relative to the   working folder on the C: drive), and can start with a backslash   without being absolute, as in "\path\file" (that's relative to the   working drive letter).  Similar subtleties might apply to other   systems; this routine figures it out using local conventions. <p>
</div>
<a name="listDir"></a>
<table class=decl><tr><td><code>listDir ( )</code><td align=right><code><a href="../file/filename.h.html">filename.h</a>[<a href="../source/filename.h.html#259">259</a>]</table><div class=desc>   Get a list of files in the directory named by this object.  Returns   a list of FileName objects giving the names of the files. <p>   The file safety settings must allow read access to the directory's   contents. <p>   On systems where the file system has special directory entries for   relative links, such as "." and ".." on Windows and Unix-likes, the   listing that this method returns will include entries for those   relative links.  Be careful with these when performing recursive   directory traversals, since recursing into "." or ".." would cause   an infinite loop.  You can test an entry in the returned list to see   if it's one of these special links by calling its getFileInfo()   method, and testing the specialLink property of the returned   information object.  Not that if you're performing a recursive   directory traversal, it might be easier to use forEachFile() with   the 'recurse' argument flag set to true. <p>
</div>
<a name="removeDirectory"></a>
<table class=decl><tr><td><code>removeDirectory (removeContents?)</code><td align=right><code><a href="../file/filename.h.html">filename.h</a>[<a href="../source/filename.h.html#311">311</a>]</table><div class=desc>   Remove the directory named by this object.  The file safety settings   must allow write access to the directory. <p>   If 'removeContents' is provided, it's a true or nil value specifying   whether or not to delete the contents of the directory before   deleting the directory itself.  If this is true, and the directory   contains any files or subdirectories, the routine will attempt to   delete those contents before deleting the directory itself.  Any   subdirectories will be recursively emptied and removed.  For obvious   reasons, use caution when using this flag.  If any of the contents   can't be deleted, the function will stop and throw an error.  Note   that if this occurs, the function might have successfully deleted   some of the contents of the directory before encountering the error;   those deletions won't be undone. <p>   If 'removeContents' is omitted or nil, and the directory isn't   already empty, the method simply returns nil (indicating failure)   without deleting anything.  This is the default because it helps   avoid accidentally deleting contents that the application didn't   explicitly choose to remove.  (Special system files that are always   present, such as "." and ".." on Unix, don't count when determining   if the directory is empty.) <p>
</div>
<a name="renameFile"></a>
<table class=decl><tr><td><code>renameFile (newname)</code><td align=right><code><a href="../file/filename.h.html">filename.h</a>[<a href="../source/filename.h.html#238">238</a>]</table><div class=desc>   Rename or move the file.  This changes the name and/or file path   location of the file named by 'self' to the given new path, which   can be a string giving a filename in local path notation, or a   FileName object with the new name.  The file safety settings must   allow write access to both the original file and the new file.   The new file must not already exist. <p>
</div>
<a name="toUniversal"></a>
<table class=decl><tr><td><code>toUniversal ( )</code><td align=right><code><a href="../file/filename.h.html">filename.h</a>[<a href="../source/filename.h.html#114">114</a>]</table><div class=desc>   Get the universal URL-style notation for this file name.  Returns   a string giving the universal notation for the file name   (including any path portion). <p>
