   Module ID.  Each library add-in can define one of these, so that the   "credits" command and the like can automatically show the version of   each library module included in the finished game, without the game's   author having to compile a list of the module versions manually. <p>   An easy way to implement a CREDITS command is to define a ModuleID   object for the game itself, and override the showCredit() method to   display the text of the game's credits.  The module object for the   game itself should usually have a listingOrder of 1, because the   author usually will want the game's information to be displayed first   in any listing that shows each included library module (such as the   VERSION command's output).

Note that   the TADS 3 library defines a module ID with listing order 50,   which is chosen so that the main library credit will appear after   the game credits but before any extension credits using the   default order value 100 that we define here.  Extensions are   free, however, to use a number lower than 5 if they wish to   appear before the main library credit. <p>

By default, we show   nothing here.  Typically, only the game's module ID object will   override this; in the game's module ID object, this method should   display any desired background information about the game that   the author wants the player to see on typing the ABOUT command. <p>   The ABOUT command conventionally displays information about the   game and its author - the kind of thing you'd find in an author's   notes section in a book - along with any special instructions to   the player, such as notes on unusual command syntax.  Information   that players will find especially helpful include: <p>   - A list of any unusual command phrasings that the game uses.   Ideally, you will disclose here every verb that's required to   complete the game, beyond the basic set common to most games   (LOOK, INVENTORY, NORTH, SOUTH, TAKE, DROP, PUT IN, etc).  By   disclosing every necessary verb and phrasing, you can be certain   to avoid "guess the verb" puzzles.  (Note that it's possible to   disclose every *required* verb without disclosing every   *accepted* verb - some verbs might be so suggestive of a   particular puzzle solution that you wouldn't want to disclose   them, but as long as you disclose less suggestive alternatives   that can be used to solve the same puzzles, you have a valid   defense against accusations of using "guess the verb" puzzles.) <p>   - A quick overview of the NPC conversation system, if any.   Conversation systems have been slowly evolving as authors   experiment with different styles, and at least three or four   different conventions have emerged.  The default that experienced   players will expect is the traditional ASK/TELL system, so it's   especially important to mention your system if you're using   something else. <p>   - An indication of the "cruelty" level of the game.  In   particular, many experienced players find it helpful to know from   the outset how careful they have to be about saving positions   throughout play, so it's helpful to point out whether or not it's   possible for the player character to be killed; whether it's   possible to get into situations where the game becomes   "unwinnable"; and if the game can become unwinnable, whether or   not this will become immediately clear.  The kindest games never   kill the PC and are always winnable, no matter what actions the   player takes; it's never necessary to save these games except to   suspend a session for later resumption.  The cruelest games kill   the PC without warning (although if they offer an UNDO command   from a "death" prompt, then even this doesn't constitute true   cruelty), and can become unwinnable in ways that aren't readily   and immediately apparent to the player, which means that the   player could proceed for quite some time (and thus invest   substantial effort) after the game is already lost. <p>   - A description of any special status line displays or other   on-screen information whose meaning might not be immediately   apparent. <p>
