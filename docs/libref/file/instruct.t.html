   Slightly adapted by Eric Eve for use with adv3Lite <p>   TADS 3 Library: Instructions for new players <p>   This module defines the INSTRUCTIONS command, which provides the   player with an overview of how to play IF games in general.  These   instructions are especially designed as an introduction to IF for   inexperienced players.  The instructions given here are meant to be   general enough to apply to most games that follow the common IF   conventions. <p>   This module defines the English version of the instructions. <p>   In most cases, each author should customize these general-purpose   instructions at least a little for the specific game.  We provide a   few hooks for some specific parameter-driven customizations that don't   require modifying the original text in this file.  Authors should also   feel free to make more extensive customizations as needed to address   areas where the game diverges from the common conventions described   here. <p>   One of the most important things you should do to customize these   instructions for your game is to add a list of any special verbs or   command phrasings that your game uses.  Of course, you might think   you'll be spoiling part of the challenge for the player if you do   this; you might worry that you'll give away a puzzle if you don't keep   a certain verb secret.  Be warned, though, that many players - maybe   even most - don't think "guess the verb" puzzles are good challenges;   a lot of players feel that puzzles that hinge on finding the right   verb or phrasing are simply bad design that make a game less   enjoyable.  You should think carefully about exactly why you don't   want to disclose a particular verb in the instructions.  If you want   to withhold a verb because the entire puzzle is to figure out what   command to use, then you have created a classic guess-the-verb puzzle,   and most everyone in the IF community will feel this is simply a bad   puzzle that you should omit from your game.  If you want to withhold a   verb because it's too suggestive of a particular solution, then you   should at least make sure that a more common verb - one that you are   willing to disclose in the instructions, and one that will make as   much sense to players as your secret verb - can achieve the same   result.  You don't have to disclose every *accepted* verb or phrasing   - as long as you disclose every *required* verb *and* phrasing, you   will have a defense against accusations of using guess-the-verb   puzzles. <p>   You might also want to mention the "cruelty" level of the game, so   that players will know how frequently they should save the game.  It's   helpful to point out whether or not it's possible for the player   character to be killed; whether it's possible to get into situations   where the game becomes "unwinnable"; and, if the game can become   unwinnable, whether or not this will become immediately clear.  The   kindest games never kill the PC and are always winnable, no matter   what actions the player takes; it's never necessary to save these   games except to suspend a session for later resumption.  The cruelest   games kill the PC without warning (although if they offer an UNDO   command from a "death" prompt, then even this doesn't constitute true   cruelty), and can become unwinnable in ways that aren't readily and   immediately apparent to the player, which means that the player could   proceed for quite some time (and thus invest substantial effort) after   the game is already effectively lost.  Note that unwinnable situations   can often be very subtle, and might not even be intended by the   author; for example, if the player needs a candle to perform an   exorcism at some point, but the candle can also be used for   illumination in dark areas, the player could make the game unwinnable   simply by using up the candle early on while exploring some dark   tunnels, and might not discover the problem until much further into   the game.
