<h1>The Security Area</h1>

<p>So far the implementation of the Security Area is a little sparse. We'll use this area of the map to introduce a couple of new puzzles, not because they're terribly good puzzles, but in order to illustrate some further features of the library. In particular we'll add a combination lock to the suitcase containing the pilot's uniform. The combination to the suitcase will be 1789, and as a clue we'll have a sticker on the suitcase mentioning the French Revolution. In case some players don't know that the French Revolution began in 1789 we'll also provide a computer on which the player character can look this up. The computer will be password protected but we'll make it easy to find the password, by putting it in a notebook in the drawer of the desk on which the computer stands. We'll start with the combination lock.</p>

<h2>Adding a Combination Lock to the Suitcase</h2>

<p>Here's a first initial attempt at adding a sticker and a lock to the suitcase:</p>

<p><div class="code"><pre>
+ suitcase: OpenableContainer 'suitcase;;case' 
   <strong> "It's a black suitcase with a combination lock and a prominent sticker
    bearing a French tricolor and the slogan &lt;q&gt;Vive la revolution
    francaise!&lt;/q&gt;. "</strong>
    initSpecialDesc = "A suitcase stands neatly placed next to the settee. "  
    
    bulk = 8
;

<strong>++ Fixture 'sticker; prominent french; tricolor'
    "The sticker is prominently marked with a tricolor and bears the slogan
    &lt;q&gt;Vive la revolution francaise!&lt;/q&gt; &amp;mdash; Long Live the French
    Revolution! "  
    
    readDesc = (desc)
;

++ comboLock: Fixture 'combination lock'
    "The combination lock consists of four small brass wheels, each of which
    can be turned to any number between 0 and 9. "
;
</strong>
</pre></div></p>

<p>If you compile and run this, however, you'll quickly discover a problem. You can use the debugging command GONEAR SUITCASE to teleport straight to the location of the suitcase and then try examining the lock and the sticker; you'll be told they're not there. The reason should be reasonably obvious: the way we've set things up puts the sticker and the lock inside the suitcase, out of sight. Obviously that's not much good, especially since once we actually lock the suitcase the lock will be inaccessibly contained within the suitcase's interior, making it impossible ever to unlock the suitcase. We need the lock and the sticker to be on the outside of the container, while the uniform goes inside. To do that we need to define a separate object to represent the lockable interior of the suitcase and attach it to the suitcase's remapIn property, just as we did when giving the short cabinet both an interior and a top:</p>

<p><div class="code"><pre>
+ suitcase: <strong>Thing</strong> 'suitcase;;case' 
    "It's a black suitcase with a combination lock and a prominent sticker
    bearing a French tricolor and the slogan &lt;q&gt;Vive la revolution
    francaise!&lt;/q&gt;. "
    initSpecialDesc = "A suitcase stands neatly placed next to the settee. "  
    
    bulk = 8
    
    <strong>remapIn: SubComponent
    {
        isOpenable = true
        lockability = indirectLockable
        isLocked = true
        bulkCapacity = 8
        indirectLockableMsg = 'You\'ll have to use the combination lock for
            that. '
    }</strong>
;
</pre></div></p>

<p>Note that in adding the remapIn SubComponent to the suitcase, we also need to change the superclass of the suitcase itself from OpenableContainer to Thing. We've also added an <span class="code">indirectLockableMsg</span> to the container defined on remapIn to respond to attempts to UNLOCK SUITCASE and the like. One other thing we have to do is to tweak the definition of the uniform so that it ends up back inside the suitcase, by adding <span class="code">subLocation = &amp;remapIn</span>:</p>

<p><div class="code"><pre>
++ uniform: Wearable 'pilot\'s uniform; timo large'  
    "It's a uniform for a Timo Airlines pilot. It's a little large for you, but
    you could probably wear it. "
    
    bulk = 6
    <strong>subLocation = &amp;remapIn</strong>
;
</pre></div></p>

<p>We still don't have a working lock, however. To do that we need a set of four brass wheels, each of which can be turned to any number from 0 to 9. Much of the behaviour we need is already defined on the <strong>NumberedDial</strong> class, which you can read all about in the <a href="../manual/gadget.htm">Gadgets</a> section of the <em>adv3Lite Library Manual</em>. A NumberedDial can be turned to any number between its <span class="code">minSetting</span> and its <span class="code">maxSetting</span>, using the TURN TO or SET TO commands.</p>

<p>This already does quite a bit of what we want our four brass combination lock wheels to do, but not everything. In particular, each of the wheels should have a similar description that includes a note of its current setting; each should report that it's part of the combination lock if the player attempts to take it; each should have a minSetting of 0 and a maxSetting of 9; and when any of them is turned to a new setting we want to check whether the combination lock is now set to the correct combination. We can save ourselves quite a bit of repetitive coding if we define this behaviour on a custom class:</p>

<p><div class="code"><pre>
class ComboWheel: NumberedDial
    desc = "It's a small brass wheel that can be turned to any number between 0
        and 9, and is currently at &lt;&lt;curSetting&gt;&gt;. "
    
    maxSetting = 9
    
    cannotTakeMsg = 'You can\'t; it\'s part of the combination lock. '
        
    makeSetting(val)
    {
        inherited(val);
        location.checkCombo();
    }
;
</pre></div></p>

<p>We don't need to define <span class="code">minSetting = 0</span> on this class since this is already the default for the NumberedDial class. The <span class="code">makeSetting(val)</span> is called whenever a NumberedDial is set to a new value, so it's a convenient place to call the method that checks whether the player now has the correct combination, a method we'll actually define on the comboLock object in which the four wheels will be located:</p>

<p><div class="code"><pre>
++ comboLock: Fixture 'combination lock'
    "The combination lock consists of four small brass wheels, each of which
    can be turned to any number between 0 and 9.<strong> They're currently showing
    the combination &lt;&lt;currentCombo&gt;&gt;. "
    
    currentCombo = (wheel1.curSetting + wheel2.curSetting + wheel3.curSetting +
                    wheel4.curSetting)
    
    correctCombo = '1789'
    
    checkCombo()
    {
        if(currentCombo == correctCombo)
        {
            reportAfter('You fancy you hear a slight click from the lock. ');
            location.remapIn.makeLocked(nil);            
        }
        else
            location.remapIn.makeLocked(true);
    }
    
;



+++ wheel1: ComboWheel 'first wheel; small brass 1'
    curSetting = '3'
    listOrder = 1
;

+++ wheel2: ComboWheel 'second wheel; small brass 2'
    curSetting = '5'
    listOrder = 2
;

+++ wheel3: ComboWheel 'third wheel; small brass 3'
    curSetting = '9'
    listOrder = 3
;

+++ wheel4: ComboWheel 'fourth wheel; small brass 4'
    curSetting = '2'
    listOrder = 4
;</strong>
</pre></div></p>

<p>We've done several things to the comboLock object here. First we've added a sentence to its description to show the combination it's currently set at. Then we've defined a  <span class="code">currentCombo</span> property which yields the current combination by concatenating the current settings of each of the four individual wheels. We also define a <span class="code">correctCombo</span> property to hold the combination that will actually unlock the suitcase. Finally we define the <span class="code">checkCombo()</span> method that's called each time any wheel is turned to a new number. This first checks whether the currentCombo is the correctCombo; if it is it unlocks the suitcase (or rather the container defined on the suitcase's remapIn property) and displays a message hinting at success. We use <span class="code">reportAfter()</span> to display this message so that the report of the click comes <em>after</em> the standard report of the wheel being turned to a new number. If the currentCombo isn't the correctCombo, then the method locks the suitcase (even if it's already locked); this ensures that setting the combination lock to anything but the correct combination will lock the suitcase again.</p>

<p>The four wheels can then be easily defined, since most of their required behaviour has already been defined on the ComboWheel class. We need to give each wheel its own vocab and its own curSetting. We also give the four wheels a listOrder in ascending sequence to ensure that whenever the wheels are listed as a group (in response to X WHEELS, say, or in a  disambiguation prompt) they are shown in the right order. The numbers in the adjective section of the vocab properties are simply to allow the wheels to be referred to as 'wheel 1', 'wheel 2' etc.</p>

<p>If you compile and run the game again, you should find that the combination lock now works as expected.</p>
<br>
<h2>The Desk and the Notebook</h2>

<p>We'll put the desk for the computer in the security centre room, which up to now has been left almost totally bare. We'll start by giving the room a description:</p>

<p><div class="code"><pre>
securityCentre: Room 'Security Centre' 'security centre'
    "Judging by the monitors on the walls, this must be some sort of security
    centre. Otherwise the room is mostly bare apart from the utilitarian desk
    located somewhere in the middle. The only way out is to the east. "
    
    east = securityArea
    out asExit(east)
;
</pre></div></p>

<p>The security monitors are merely scenery; we can implement them briskly as a Decoration:</p>

<p><div class="code"><pre>
+ Decoration 'security monitors; blank; screens ;them'
    "They're all blank; either they're switched off or they're not working. "
    
    notImportantMsg = 'You really don\'t have time to play around with the
        monitors. '
;
</pre></div></p>

<p>The desk requires a little more thought, since this is to have a drawer. The drawer can be implemented as a separate object, but we still want OPEN DESK and the like to refer to the drawer. We can do that by having the desk's remapIn property refer to the drawer while using its remapOn property to provide it with a surface as a desktop:</p>

<p><div class="code"><pre>
+ desk: Heavy 'desk; utilitarian metal'
    "It's a utilitarian metal desk with a single drawer. "
    
    remapIn = drawer
    remapOn: SubComponent { }    
;

++ drawer: Fixture, OpenableContainer 'drawer'
    
    bulkCapacity = 5
    
    cannotTakeMsg = 'The drawer is part of the desk. '
;
</pre></div></p>

<p>The only thing new here is the use of the <strong>Heavy</strong> class to define the desk. This is almost the same as making it a Fixture, except that it provides a custom <span class="code">cannotTakeMsg</span>, 'The desk is too heavy to move around'. Next we add the notebook in the drawer:</p>

<p><div class="code"><pre>
+++ notebook: Thing 'notebook; little green book; writing'
    "It's just a little green book with writing in it. "
    
    readDesc = "It turns to be full of lots of sets of random-looking
        characters, all crossed out apart from the last, which reads
        &lt;&lt;password&gt;&gt;. "

    password = 'B49qJt0'
    
    dobjFor(Open) asDobjFor(Read)
;
</pre></div></p>

<p>There's just a couple of points to note about this object definition. The first, a minor one, is that we've given the notebook a <span class="code">password</span> property to make it easy to refer to the password elsewhere (as we soon shall), and to ensure that everything still works if we decide we want to change the password (in a more elaborate version we might choose a new random password at the start of each game, for example).</p>

<p>Of more note is the line <span class="code">dobjFor(Open) asDobjFor(Read)</span>, which means "treat OPEN NOTEBOOK the same as READ NOTEBOOK", or to put it slightly more technically, "when this object is the direct object of an OPEN command, treat it as if it were the direct object of a READ command." OPEN NOTEBOOK is certainly a reasonable thing for the player to try, and this gives a perfectly good response for very little effort; it's about the easiest way to provide a custom response to a command.</p>

<p>If you like, you can try compiling and running the game again, using GONEAR SECURITY CENTRE to teleport straight to our newly-furnished room, and then try finding and reading the notebook.</p>
<br>
<h2><a name="consult">Looking Things up on the Computer</a></h2>
<p>Finally, we need to implement the computer, so that the player can look up the French Revolution on it. The adv3Lite library defines a <strong>Consultable</strong> class for this kind of thing. A Consultable responds to commands like CONSULT <em>something</em> ABOUT <em>sometopic</em> or LOOK UP <em>sometopic</em> IN <em>something</em> or LOOK UP <em>sometopic</em> ON <em>something</em>, and several other such equivalent variants. We'll also make the computer inherit from the Heavy class (which we also used for the desk) so the player character can't pick it up and carry it around, and we'll give it a specialDesc to make sure that the player knows that it's there:</p>

<p><div class="code"><pre>
++ computer: Heavy, Consultable 'computer;; pc keyboard screen'
    
    specialDesc = "A computer sits squarely on top of the desk. "
    subLocation = &amp;remapOn
;
</pre></div></p>

<p>That's all very well, but this definition doesn't tell the computer how to respond to specific requests for information. To do that we have to supply it with a number of <strong>ConsultTopic</strong> objects which we locate directly within the computer (i.e. in this case we preceed them with +++ to indicate a further level of containment nesting). But before we can do that, we have to take a prior step. You'll recall we said that a Consultable responds to commands like LOOK UP <em>sometopic</em> ON <em>something</em>. Well, the computer is certainly <em>something</em> but what about the French Revolution? That's hardly a thing in the normal sense of the term, and it's certainly not an object implemented in our airport game, so how are we going to refer to it?</p>

<p>The answer is to define it not as a <span class="code">Thing</span> but a <em>Topic</em>. A Topic is a game object that doesn't represent a physical object, or at least, doesn't represent a physical object implemented in the game, but instead represents something more abstract, such as liberty, equality, fraternity or, as here, the French Revolution. To define a Topic we simply define an object of the Topic class and give it a vocab property:</p>

<p><div class="code"><pre>
tFrenchRevolution: Topic 'french revolution';
</pre></div></p>

<p>A convenient place to put this definition might be right at the end of the start.t file, out of the way of anything else. Since the player might reasonably use our simulated computer to look up flight departures, we might as well define a topic for that while we're at it too:</p>

<p><div class="code"><pre>
tFlightDepartures: Topic 'flight departures; plane; times';
</pre></div></p>

<p>The vocab property of a Topic is defined just like that for a Thing, so here we've ensured that the tFlightDepartures Topic will match FLIGHT TIMES, PLANE DEPARTURES and PLANE TIMES as well as FLIGHT DEPARTURES. Note that there's nothing magical about prefacing the object names of these Topics with t, that's just a convention I employ to make Topics easily recognizable as such when I reference them elsewhere in my code. For the full story on Topics see the section on <a href="../manual/topic.htm">Topics</a> in the <em>adv3Lite Library Manual</em>.</p>

<p>The next step is to associate these topics with appropriate responses from our computer. As mentioned the way to do that is to define a couple of ConsultTopic objects located directly in the computer. The template notation makes this quick and easy:</p>

<p><div class="code"><pre>
+++ ConsultTopic @tFrenchRevolution
    "According to Wikipedia, the French Revolution began in 1789. The article
    goes on to tell you quite a bit more about it, but you don't have time to
    read it all now. "
;

+++ ConsultTopic @tFlightDepartures
    "So far as you can tell from the information displayed, Timo Flight 179 to
    Buenos Aires is likely to be the only one out of here for the next several
    hours, all the others being delayed for a variety of annoying reasons such
    as strikes, illness and inclement weather. "
;
</pre></div></p>

<p>Here we define the topic we want the ConsultTopic to respond to after an @ sign as the first element of the template, and the response we get as a double-quoted string as the second element. Note that the object following the @ sign doesn't have to be a Topic; it could also be a Thing defined elsewhere in our game if we wanted to look it up in/on something.</p>

<p>We also need to define what response the computer gives (or in this case, a reason for not even trying to get a response) when the player tries to look up something we haven't supplied a specific response for. We can do this by means of a <strong>DefaultConsultTopic</strong>, which is what the game will resort to if it can't find a more specific ConsultTopic that matches what the player asked for: </p>

<p><div class="code"><pre>
+++ DefaultConsultTopic
    "That's of no immediate interest to you right now; you have more urgent
    things to attend to. "
;
</pre></div></p>

<p>For the full story on Consultables and ConsultTopics, see the section on <a href="../manual/topicentry.htm">Topic Entries</a> in the <em>adv3Lite Library Manual</em>.</p>
<br>
<h2>Complicating the Computer</h2>

<p>The computer now works to provide the player with a strong clue about the combination needed to open the suitcase, together with the information about the lack of alternative flights out of the airport at any time in the near future, but we did say we'd make things a little more different. In particular, before the player character can look anything up on the computer he first needs to switch it on and then enter a password. This will make the computer the most complex object we've defined so far, so we'll take it step-by-step.</p>

<p>The first step is to define a couple of properties to keep track of the computer's state. We'll use the standard <span class="code">isOn</span> property to keep track of whether it's on or off, and set <span class="code">isSwitchable = true</span> so that the player character can turn it on and off. Then we'll define a custom <span class="code">passwordEntered</span> property to keep track of whether the password has been entered since turning the computer on. We can use the <span class="code">makeOn(stat)</span> method to reset <span class="code">passwordEntered</span> to nil each time we turn the computer on, and also to display appropriate messages about the computer being turned on and off. We can also use the <span class="code">isOn</span> and <span class="code">passwordEntered</span> properties to change the description of the computer according to its state:</p>

<p><div class="code"><pre>
++ computer: Heavy, Consultable 'computer;; pc keyboard screen'
   <strong> "The computer is currently &lt;&lt;if isOn&gt;&gt;on and &lt;&lt;if passwordEntered&gt;&gt; ready
    for use&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt; waiting for you to enter a password&lt;&lt;end&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;
    off&lt;&lt;end&gt;&gt;."</strong>
    
    specialDesc = "A computer sits squarely on top of the desk. "
    subLocation = &amp;remapOn
    
   <strong> isSwitchable = true
    
    makeOn(stat)
    {
        inherited(stat);
        if(stat)
        {
            "The computer rapidly boots up and displays a screen asking you
            to enter a password. ";
            passwordEntered = nil;
        }
        else
            "The computer rapidly powers down. ";
    }
    
    passwordEntered = nil</strong>
</pre></div></p>

<p>For the next step, we need to prevent the player from looking anything up on the computer either if it isn't switched on or if it's still waiting for a password. For this we need to override it's handling of the <span class="code">ConsultAbout</span> command, which handles commands of the form CONSULT COMPUTER ABOUT DEPARTURES or LOOK UP FRENCH REVOLUTION ON COMPUTER. We've already seen a couple of examples of customizing what commands do by using an <span class="code">action()</span> method within a  <span class="code">dobjFor(SomeAction)</span> block. Actually, this is just a convenient way of defining a method called actionDobjSomeAction(), but if you find that a little puzzling you can either ignore it totally for now or read about <em>Property Sets</em> in the section on "Object Definitions" in Part III of the <em>TADS 3 System Manual</em>. What's more to the immediate point is that it isn't the action stage we want to override here, because we don't want to change what the ConsultAbout action <em>does</em>, but when it's allowed to do it.</p>

<p>There are earlier stages at which we can intervene to prevent an action from taking place, the <strong>verify</strong> stage and the <strong>check</strong> stage. We don't often have to override a verify() method in adv3Lite games, since we can normally override properties like <span class="code">isEnterable</span> and <span class="code">canPutBehindMe</span> instead, which properties affect the way the verify method works. Each action has a verify method that is used to check for certain obvious illogicalities, such as trying to put an object into itself.  The verify method also checks the boolean property is<em>Blankable</em> so this gives you easy control over whether the action is considered sensible.  If you want to rule out an action as illogical for a given object, just set is<em>Blank</em>able to nil, and then set the cannot<em>Blank</em>Message to customize the reason that is given to the player when that action is attempted.</p>

<p>Because the verify method respects the is<em>Blank</em>able and cant<em>Blank</em>Message properties, you are unlikely to need to override the verify method.  However, if for some reason you do need to override the verify method, it is recommended that you also call the inherited method so that the basic sanity tests on the action will also be performed.</p>

<p>We shan't override a verify method now, since it wouldn't be a good choice here. A verify method affects the parser's choice of objects; if we prevent an action from going ahead in a verify routine we're telling the parser that this object is a bad choice for this action; but the computer is a good choice for the ConsultAbout action, so stopping the action at the check stage would be a much better choice. If you want to do other kinds of checks that potentially block an action from happening, without affecting the parser's choice of objects, the check method is your hook for accomplishing this.  Printing any message in the check method will block the action, so simply override the check method with the tests you want to perform and the corresponding blocking messages you want to display. In this case we want to stop the action from going ahead either if the computer hasn't been turned on yet (<span class="code">isOn == nil</span>) or if the password hasn't been entered yet (<span class="code">passwordEntered == nil</span>). Our check routine should therefore look like this:</p>

<p><div class="code"><pre>
    dobjFor(ConsultAbout)
    {
        check()
        {
            if(!isOn)
                "You can't do that until the computer is switched on. ";
            else if(!passwordEntered)
                "You'll need to enter a password first. ";
        }
    }
</pre></div></p>

<p>For further information on the check() stage in general, see the <a href="../manual/actres.htm#check">Action Responses</a> section of the <em>adv3Lite Library Manual</em>.</p>

<p>Finally, we need to provide a way for the player to enter the password on the computer. The EnterOn action does what we want: it accepts commands of the form ENTER <em>someliteral</em> ON <em>someobject</em> (e.g. ENTER P345 ON COMPUTER). <em>Someobject</em> is then the direct object of the command, while we can get the value of <em>someliteral</em> (i.e. what the player wants to enter on the computer) from the pseudo-global variable <span class="code">gLiteral</span>.</p>

<p>The library provides no default handling for the EnterOn action apart from ruling it out at the verify stage. To allow the action to go ahead at all we therefore first need to define <span class="code">canEnterOnMe = true</span> on the computer.</p>

<p>To make something happen when the player tries to enter something on the computer, we need to define what we want to happen at the action stage. Our routine should first check whether the password entered by the player matches the password in the notebook. If it does, then the routine should tell the player that s/he's been successful and set <span class="code">passwordEntered</span> to true, to signal that the correct password has now been entered. If it doesn't, then we just need to display a message telling the player that the password s/he just tried to enter is incorrect.</p>

<p>We probably don't want to allow the player to keep entering commands once the password has been accepted since we're not trying to emulate a complete PC here; a good solution would be a check method that doesn't allow the EnterOn action to go ahead once <span class="code">passwordEntered</span> is true.</p>

<p>Our handling for the EnterOn action, which allows the player character to enter a password on the computer (once it is switched on), thus looks like this:</p>
    
 <p><div class="code"><pre>   
    canEnterOnMe = true
    
    dobjFor(EnterOn)
    {
        check()
        {
            if(!isOn)
                "You can't do that until the computer is switched on. ";
            else if(passwordEntered)
                "You've already entered the password; this is no time to start
                playing around with random commands. ";
        }
        
        action()
        {
            if(gLiteral == notebook.password)
            {
                "The computer displays WELCOME for a few seconds, and then
                clears to allow you to enter commands. ";
                
                passwordEntered  = true;
            }
            else
                "The computer flashes PASSWORD NOT RECOGNIZED at you. ";
                
        }
    }

<p>One additional refinement we could add is to make TYPE PASSWORD ON COMPUTER work the same as ENTER PASSWORD ON COMPUTER, which we can do easily enough by defining <span class="code">dobjFor(TypeOn) asDobjFor(EnterOn)</span>. The complete object definition for the computer then looks like this:</p>

<p><div class="code"><pre>
++ computer: Heavy, Consultable 'computer;; pc keyboard screen'
    "The computer is currently &lt;&lt;if isOn&gt;&gt;on and &lt;&lt;if passwordEntered&gt;&gt; ready

    off&lt;&lt;end&gt;&gt;. "
    
    specialDesc = "A computer sits squarely on top of the desk. "
    subLocation = &amp;remapOn
    
    isSwitchable = true
    
    makeOn(stat)
    {
        inherited(stat);
        if(stat)
        {

            to enter a password. ";
            passwordEntered = nil;
        }
        else

    }
    
    passwordEntered = nil
    
    dobjFor(ConsultAbout)

        check()
        {
            if(!isOn)

    }

    dobjFor(EnterOn)

            else
