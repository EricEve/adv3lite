<h1>Furnishing the Cockpit</h1>

<p>Up to this point we have left the cockpit as a bare room with not even a description. The time has come to start implementing it. The first question to consider, however, is just how much detail we want to go into. Interactive Fiction is not a good medium in which to implement a flight simulator, and we shall not attempt to do so here. On the other hand, we need to provide some means for the player to get the plane off the ground and win the game, and we ideally need to allow some amount of interactivity in the process.</p>

<p>The solution we'll adopt here is to implement a basic set of controls with somewhat limited interactivity: a control column with a wheel, a thrust lever, and an engine start button. We'll also implement three basic instruments: an airspeed indicator, an altimeter and a fuel gauge. Nothing will do anything until the engines are running, but once the engine start button is pushed we'll use a cut-scene to taxi the aircraft away from the jetway to the start of the runway. An IF purist might complain that cutscenes aren't best practice in IF, but it's probably the least bad option here, and in any case trying to implement a taxying-round-airport simulator is way beyond the scope of this manual. Once the cutscene is ended, the player must push the thrust lever full forward, and then pull back on the control column when the aeroplane reaches the right airspeed. Pulling back too soon or too late may result in a fatal crash. Pulling back at around the right time will cause the plane to take off and the game to be won.</p>

<p>The first step is to give the cockpit a decent description:</p>

 <p><div class="code"><pre>
cockpit: Room 'Cockpit' 'cockpit'
    <strong>"The cockpit is quite small but has everything you might expect: a
    windscreen looking forward, a pilot's seat from which you can operate all
    the usual controls, and a door leading out aft. "</strong>
    aft = cabinDoor
    south asExit(aft)
    out asExit(aft)
    
    regions = [planeRegion]
;
</pre></div>

<p>Next we need to implement the pilot's seat and the controls. For the seat we can use a Platform, and set <span class="code">dobjFor(Enter) asDobjFor(Board)</span> so that SIT IN SEAT will do the same as SIT ON SEAT. We'll use a single object to represent the controls as a group, and then make the individual controls and instruments components of the controls object by locating them within it. This will make it relatively easy to enforce a couple of conditions: to operate the controls you have to be sitting in the pilot's seat, and from the pilot's seat the only things you can reach in the cockpit are the controls. Here's how we can start this off (putting these object definitions immediately after that of the cabinDoor that's already in the cockpit):</p>

 <p><div class="code"><pre>
+ pilotSeat: Fixture, Platform 'pilot\'s seat'
        
    dobjFor(Enter) asDobjFor(Board)
    
    allowReachOut(obj)
    {
        return obj.isOrIsIn(controls);
    }
;

+ controls: Fixture 'controls;; instruments;them'
    "The instruments and controls of most immediate interest to you are
    &lt;&lt;makeListStr(contents, &amp;theName)&gt;&gt;. "
    
    checkReach(actor)
    {
        if(!actor.isIn(pilotSeat))
            "You really need to be sitting in the pilot's seat before you start
            operating the controls. ";
    }
;
</pre></div>

<p>The first point of note here is the use of a Platform to implement the seat. For an actor to be able to get on (sit on/stand on/lie on) an object, the object's <span class="code">contType</span> must be <span class="code">On</span> and its <span class="code">isBoardable</span> property true; a Platform is basically the subclass of Thing that fulfils these two conditions. For an actor to be able to get <em>in</em> (sit in/stand in/lie in) an object its <span class="code">contType</span> must be <span class="code">In</span> and its <span class="code">isEnterable</span> property true. The subclass of Thing that fulfils those two conditions is <span class="code">Booth</span>, but something can't be both a Booth and a Platform at the same time, since its contType can't be simultaneously In and On. To allow the player character to SIT IN SEAT as well as SIT ON SEAT we therefore define <span class="code">dobjFor(Enter) asDobjFor(Board)</span> on the seat, which means 'Treat ENTER SEAT as BOARD SEAT'. Since SIT IN SEAT is treated as ENTER SEAT, this makes SIT IN SEAT behave like BOARD SEAT, which is what SIT ON SEAT also does. The wider lesson here is that if you want to define a piece of furniture which the player can get in or on without it meaning anything much different, define it as a Platform and add <span class="code">dobjFor(Enter) asDobjFor(Board)</span>.</p>

<p>The second point of note is the use of <span class="code">allowReachOut(obj)</span> on the seat to control which items are in reach of someone sitting on the seat (the seat itself and anything on the seat are automatically in reach). Here we want the controls objects and all its contents to be reachable from the seat, so we get the method to return <span class="code">obj.isOrIsIn(controls)</span>, which will be true either if obj is the <span class="code">controls</span> object or if it is directly or indirectly contained in the <span class="code">controls</span> object. The default behaviour if an actor sitting on the chair tries to reach anything else is to move the actor out of the chair, which is absolutely fine here.</p>

<p>The third point is the use of the <span class="code">checkReach(actor)</span> method on the <span class="code">controls</span> object to control where the controls are reachable from. If the method displays anything (normally a reason why the object or its contents can't be reached) then the contents of the object and the object itself are considered out of reach to the actor. We can therefore use this method to display a message saying that you need to be in the pilot's seat to operate the controls if the actor isn't in the pilot's seat.</p>

<p>The fourth point is the use of <span class="code">&lt;&lt;makeListStr(contents, &amp;theName)&gt;&gt;</span> to provide a list of the controls, which we're about to locate in the <span class="code">controls</span> object. The <span class="code">contents</span> parameter simply refers to the contents of the controls object, which we're about to define. The option <span class="code">&amp;theName</span> parameter tells the <span class="code">makeListStr()</span> to use the theName property of each item in the contents when building its list, instead of the aName property it would otherwise have used by default, since it will look more natural to list the names of the controls with the definite article here.</p>

<p>Before we go on, let's pause and look at the second and third points in a bit more detail. Note first of all that although they have similar names, they're not mirror images of each other, and they do work a little differently. <span class="code">allowReachOut(obj)</span> takes the <em>object</em> to be reached as its parameter and returns true or nil depending on whether an actor can reach the object from within the container on which the method is defined. <span class="code">checkReach(actor)</span> takes the <em>actor</em> doing the reaching as its parameter and displays a message if the actor can't reach the object on which it's defined (and so can't reach inside the object either). There is also a <span class="code">checkReachIn(actor)</span> method which you can use if you want reaching inside an object to be possible under different conditions from reaching the object itself, but by default <span class="code">checkReachIn(actor)</span> just calls <span class="code">checkReach(actor)</span>.</p>

<p>The reason for the difference between the two methods is that they're modelling slightly different circumstances. <span class="code">allowReachOut(obj)</span> is typically intended for cases where an actor is on a piece of furniture like a chair or bed and may not be able to reach everything in the room from that container. If an object can't be reached it's because it's too far away, and the obvious default behaviour is for the actor to leave the container to reach the object s/he's trying to reach. If we want to disallow this default for any reason, which we can do by setting <span class="code">autoGetOutToReach</span> to nil, then the default refusal message of the form "You can't reach the bookcase from the armchair" will nearly always be appropriate, so we don't generally need to provide a means for producing a custom message. On the other hand <span class="code">checkReach(obj)</span> and <span class="code">checkReachIn(obj)</span> are intended to model a whole range of situations where an object can't be reached; perhaps it's too high up on a shelf, or perhaps it's too hot to touch, or perhaps there's a venomous spider on it, or perhaps there's some other reason. It's therefore generally necessary to provide a custom refusal message for each particular case, so a method that just returns true or nil won't do. We therefore define a couple of methods that work like a check() routine; if they display anything they're disallowing the action; and these methods are in fact called at the check() stage (via the touchObj precondition, if you want to get technical). It's therefore appropriate to give them names that start with check.</p>

<p>There is a further asymmetry between the two cases that result in one taking the object to be reached as its parameter and the other the actor doing the reaching. In the case of <span class="code">allowReachOut(obj)</span> we know exactly where the actor doing the reaching is; s/he's in or on the piece of furniture on which we're defining the <span class="code">allowReachOut(obj)</span> method, and whether obj is reachable from there or not depends on which obj it is and where it is located. In the case of <span class="code">canReach(actor)</span> or <span class="code">canReachIn(actor)</span> we already know precisely which object is being reached and/or where it is; it's the object on which we're defining the method, and whether the actor can reach it or not may well depend on the location of the actor.</p>

<p>The most typical kind of case where we might use <span class="code">checkReach()</span> and/or <span class="code">checkReachIn()</span> is, say, to represent a high shelf which the actor can only reach when s/he's standing on a ladder or a chair. Here we're using it a bit differently to prevent the player character operating the cockpit controls unless he's sitting in the pilot's seat. Of course, strictly speaking, an actor wouldn't actually have to be sitting in the seat to reach the controls, but it's far easier to trap every attempt to touch them in a single checkReach() method than it would be to attempt to trap every action that might count as manipulating the controls to fly the plane. By placing the individual controls within the <span class="code">controls</span> object, that is just what we can do. So the next step is to define the individual instruments and controls, locating them in the <span class="code">controls</span> object, although at this stage their implementations will be a little sketchy:</p>

 <p><div class="code"><pre>
++ controlColumn: Fixture 'control column;;stick'
    "It's basically a stick that can be pushed forward or pulled back, with a
    wheel attached at the top. "
    listOrder = 10
;

+++ wheel: Fixture 'wheel'
    "The wheel can be turned to port or starboard to steer the aircraft. "
;

++ thrustLever: Fixture 'thrust lever'
    "It's a lever that can be pushed forward or pulled back. "
    listOrder = 20
;

++ ignitionButton: Button 'engine ignition button; big green'
    "It's a big green button. "
    listOrder = 30
    isOn = nil
    
    makePushed()
    {
        if(isOn)
            "The engines are already running. ";
        else
        {
            isOn = true;
            "The plane judders as the engines roar into life. ";
        }
    }
;

++ asi: Fixture 'airspeed indicator; air speed; asi'
    "It's currently registering an airspeed of &lt;&lt;airspeed&gt;&gt; knots. "
    listOrder = 40
    
    airspeed = 0
;

++ altimeter: Fixture 'altimeter'
    "It's currently indicating an altitude of &lt;&lt;altitude&gt;&gt; feet. "
    listOrder = 50
    
    altitude = 0
;

++ fuelGauge: Fixture 'fuel gauge'
    "It's currently registering full. "
    listOrder = 60
;

+ windscreen: Fixture 'windscreen;; window windshield'
;
</pre></div>

<p>The implementation is deliberately incomplete at this stage, since completing it will be the task that occupies the remainder of this chapter. The main thing to note right now is the use of the <strong>Button</strong> class to implement the ignition button. In the adv3Lite library a Button is fixed by default (since buttons are nearly always part of something else, and not free-standing items that can be picked up and carried around by themselves), so there's no need to define <span class="code">isFixed = true</span>. A Button doesn't do much by default. If pushed a Button's <span class="code">makePushed()</span> method is called, but does nothing by default, so this is a good place to put code to make the Button do something useful. Here we make it display a message and set <span class="code">isOn</span> to true if it wasn't already. A Button doesn't have an <span class="code">isOn</span> property by default, but there's nothing to stop our giving it one, as here. If we hadn't overridden the <span class="code">makePushed()</span> method the response to PUSH BUTTON would have been "Click", but the text output by our custom <span class="code">makePushed()</span> method displaces this default response for reason's we'll look at later.</p>

<p>We've also given custom <span class="code">airspeed</span> and <span class="code">altitude</span> properties to the air speed indicator and the altimeter respectively, so that their descriptions can mention what these instruments are measuring. We haven't bothered to do this with the fuel gauge, because the game will end before the plane has used a significant amout of fuel.</p>

<p>We've also defined the listOrder on each of the controls and instruments; this is principally to ensure that &lt;&lt;makeListStr(contents, &amp;theName)&gt;&gt; in the description of the <span class="code">controls</span> object lists these instruments in the order we want.</p>

<p>In the next section we'll start discussing how to make the controls respond to commands, which will involve our learning how to define actions.</p>
