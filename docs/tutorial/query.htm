<h1>Queries and Suggestions</h1>

<p>We've set things up so that at some point in the game the player character can learn the flight attendant's name. Presumably this comes about because he asks her &mdash; or at least has the opportunity of asking her. But this may not be the only thing the player character wants to ask her about herself.</p>

<p>In the conventional ASK/TELL system we could create a 'name' topic and then define a TopicEntry that responds to ASK ATTENDANT ABOUT NAME, but this doesn't seem altogether a natural way to converse. Or we could set up a TopicEntry that refers to angela object itself, something like:</p>

 <p><div class="code"><pre>
+ AskTopic @angela
    "&lt;q&gt;Tell me about yourself,&lt;/q&gt; you say.\b
    &lt;q&gt;I'm called Angela,&lt;/q&gt; she tells you. "
;
</pre></div>

<p>We might locate this directly in the angela object (hence only the single + sign) on the basis that the player character might ask Angela about herself at any point in the game. That's fair enough, but there are several other things we could improve. For one thing, it may not occur to every player to try ASK ATTENDANT ABOUT HERSELF; perhaps we might want to drop a hint that this might be a good idea. For another, the syntax ASK ATTENDANT ABOUT HERSELF doesn't give the player that much agency. How do we know that it's the attendant's name he wants to ask about, rather than, say, whether she enjoys her work or what she's doing that evening? Let's see what we can do about each of these issues in turn.</p>

<h2>Suggesting Topics of Conversation</h2>

<p>The adv3Lite library allows you to suggest topics of conversation to the player, either in response to an explicit TOPICS command typed by the player, or when you the game author think it would be appropriate to do so (e.g. by using a <span class="code">&lt;.topics&gt;</span> tag). But for this to work, the game needs to know which topics to suggest, and what to call them. In adv3Lite all you have to do is to give a TopicEntry a name property and the game will know to suggest it by that name. In this case, for example, we could write this:</p>

<p><div class="code"><pre>
+ AskTopic @angela
    "&lt;q&gt;Tell me about yourself,&lt;/q&gt; you say.\b
    &lt;q&gt;I'm called Angela,&lt;/q&gt; she tells you. "
    
    name = 'herself'
;
</pre></div>

<p>Then, once the player character is in conversation with Angela, the player can type TOPICS and the game will respond with "You could ask her about herself."</p>

<p>Now let's add a second topic of conversation. Suppose the player character wants to know when the plane is going to leave. We could use the flight departures Topic we've already defined to create a new AskTopic for Angela:</p>

 <p><div class="code"><pre>
+ AskTopic @tFlightDepartures    
    "&lt;q&gt;When is this plane going to leave?&lt;/q&gt; you ask.\b
    &lt;q&gt;Just as soon as the pilot comes aboard,&lt;/q&gt; she tells you. &lt;.reveal
    pilot-awaited&gt; "   
    
    name = 'flight departures'
;
</pre></div>

<p>Note the use of the <span class="code"><.reveal pilot-awaited></span> tag here to note that our protagonist has just learned the highly significant fact that there isn't yet a pilot aboard. Then consider something else: the way we previously defined the tFlightDepartures Topic object already gave it a name of 'flight departures', which we're now repeating in the name property of the AskTopic. In this sort of situation we can avoid the repetition by telling the TopicEntry to take its name property from that of its matchObj (here tFlightDepartures). To do that we can just define <span class="code">autoName = true</span> on the TopicEntry instead of spelling out the name explicitly:</p>

 <p><div class="code"><pre>
+ AskTopic @tFlightDepartures    
    "&lt;q&gt;When is this plane going to leave?&lt;/q&gt; you ask.\b
    &lt;q&gt;Just as soon as the pilot comes aboard,&lt;/q&gt; she tells you. &lt;.reveal
    pilot-awaited&gt; "   
    
    <strong>autoName = true</strong>
;
</pre></div>

<p>In this case this doesn't quite give us what we'd ideally like, since the game will now suggest "You could ask her about the flight departures" and we don't really want the definite article here. We could fix that by tweaking the way we defined the vocab property of the tFlightDepartures Topic object:</p>

 <p><div class="code"><pre>
tFlightDepartures: Topic '<strong>()</strong> flight departures; plane; times';
</pre></div>

<p>Adding the () at the start of the vocab property tells adv3Lite to treat the name as a qualified name and so omit the article.</p>

<p>The reply to the question about flight departures invites a further question about the missing pilot, but only when the player character knows that the pilot is missing:</p>

 <p><div class="code"><pre>
+ AskTopic @tPilot
    "&lt;q&gt;What's happened to the pilot?&lt;/q&gt; you ask.\b
    &lt;q&gt;I don't know; we're still waiting for him,&lt;/q&gt; she replies. &lt;q&gt;But don't
    worry; I'm sure he'll turn up any moment now.&lt;/q&gt; "

    autoName = true
    isActive = gRevealed('pilot-awaited')
;
</pre></div>

<p>This of course requires us to define the tPilot Topic somewhere; the best place would be wherever we've put our other Topic objects:</p>

 <p><div class="code"><pre>
tPilot: Topic 'pilot';
</pre></div>

<p>If you try compiling and running the game now and going to talk to Angela, you'll find that when you first type TOPICS the game will respond with "You could ask her about herself or about flight departures." The pilot topic isn't suggested, since it isn't available until its isActive property becomes true, so there's no point in suggesting it. Once the player has typed ASK ATTENDANT ABOUT DEPARTURES and received the response about waiting for the pilot, the topic does become available and so will be suggested.</p>

<p>One other thing you'll find is that once you've asked about a suggested topic, it's no longer suggested. The game won't keep suggesting topics the player has already tried.</p>

<p>For the full story on suggesting topics of conversation to the player, see the section on <a href="../manual/suggest.htm">Suggesting Conversational Topics</a> in the Adv3Lite Library Manual.</p>
<br>
<h2>Queries</h2>

<p>We suggested earlier on that specific questions we might want to ask about Angela might include what her name is, whether she enjoys her work, or whether she's free for dinner that evening. While the ask/tell system would allow us to provide responses to ASK WOMAN ABOUT NAME, ASK ABOUT WORK and ASK ABOUT DINNER, none of these quite supplies the precise nuance we're looking for. Allowing players to pose these more specific kind of questions is beyond the ability of the basic ask/tell system. One way in which the adv3Lite conversation system extends beyond basic ask/tell, however, is in allowing for precisely this kind of question. It does this through a special kind of TopicEntry called a <strong>QueryTopic</strong>, which can respond to questions of the form ASK WHERE|WHEN|WHO|WHAT|WHY|WHETHER|HOW|IF such-and-such. </p>

<p>The question being put to an NPC via a QueryTopic consists of two parts: the <em>type</em> of query ('who', 'what', 'why', 'when', 'what', 'whether', 'if' or 'how'), known as the <strong>qtype</strong>, and the topic representing the such-and-such part. A QueryTopic for asking Angela about her name might thus look like this:</p>

 <p><div class="code"><pre>
+ QueryTopic 'what' @tHerName
    "&lt;q&gt;What's your name?&lt;/q&gt; you ask.\b
    &lt;q&gt;Angela,&lt;/q&gt; she replies. "
;
</pre></div>

<p>This would then require us to define a <span class="code">tHerName</span> topic object that might look something like this:</p>

 <p><div class="code"><pre>
tHerName: Topic 'her name is; your';
</pre></div>

<p>We add 'your' as an additional vocab word in case the player types WHAT IS YOUR NAME (some players will certainly try this, and we'll want it to work; players can be guaranteed to ignore the wording you actually give them and then complain that your game is buggy when they try everything <em>but</em> the wording you gave them). A QueryTopic defines <span class="code">autoName = true</span> by default, so we want to define the name part of the topic vocab to read well after "You could ask her what "; the game will supply the suggestion automatically, since players can't be expected to guess what QueryTopics you've implemented and the possibilities are simply too great for random experimentation to be a fruitful player strategy.</p>

<p>This works, but unless you're going to use the 'her name is' topic on a number of different QueryTopics, it may seem a bit tedious to have to define it in addition to the QueryTopic. Adv3Lite therefore allows you to define it directly on the QueryTopic thus:</p>

 <p><div class="code"><pre>
+ QueryTopic 'what' 'her name is; your'
    "&lt;q&gt;What's your name?&lt;/q&gt; you ask.\b
    &lt;q&gt;Angela,&lt;/q&gt; she replies. "
;
</pre></div>

<p>This actually does precisely the same thing; it simply makes the library define the Topic object for you. In this case the library will define a new Topic object with a vocab property of 'her name is; your' and make it the matchObj of your QueryTopic. This is probably easier when you'd otherwise have to define a separate Topic you'd never use anywhere else.</p>

<p>In this kind of case you can, if you like, run the qtype string and the topic vocab string into one, like this:</p>

 <p><div class="code"><pre>
+ QueryTopic 'what her name is; your'
    "&lt;q&gt;What's your name?&lt;/q&gt; you ask.\b
    &lt;q&gt;Angela,&lt;/q&gt; she replies. "
;
</pre></div>

<p>When the library doesn't find a separate qtype (i.e. when it finds only one string defined on the template) it takes the first word of the string it finds to be the qtype ('who', 'what', 'when', etc.) and the remainder of the string to be vocab of the associated Topic. This actually appears quite transparent, since the single string 'what her name is' indeed corresponds to the question ASK WHAT HER NAME IS, but it's well to be aware that things are a little more complicated behind the scenes.</p>

<p>Although we now have a QueryTopic that responds to ASK WHAT HER NAME IS (or, indeed, to WHAT IS YOUR NAME), it doesn't quite do everything we want. When Angela tells the player character her name, we want her displayed name to change from 'the flight attendant' to 'Angela'. To do that we need both to change her name property and to set <span class="code">proper = true</span> (to indicate that she now has a proper name), so that she's not referred to as 'the Angela'. It will be convenient to define a <span class="code">makeProper()</span> method that does this for us and then returns her name: </p>

 <p><div class="code"><pre>
angela: Actor 'flight attendant; statuesque young; woman angela; her'
    @planeFront
    "She's a statuesque and by no means unattractive young woman. "
    
    checkAttackMsg = 'That would be cruel and unnecessary. '
    
    globalParamName = 'angela'
    
    <strong>makeProper
    {
        proper = true;
        name = 'Angela';
        return name;
    }</strong>
;
</pre></div>

<p>We can then call this method in the QueryTopic so that it changes her name to Angela at the same time as telling the player character that that's what her name is. We don't want to do this twice; once the player character has asked her name once, there's no need to do it again, so at the same time we want to define the QueryTopic so that it's isActive property becomes nil once Angela has a proper name:</p>

 <p><div class="code"><pre>
+ QueryTopic 'what' 'her name is; your'
    "&lt;q&gt;What's your name?&lt;/q&gt; you ask.\b
    &lt;q&gt;&lt;&lt;getActor.makeProper&gt;&gt;,&lt;/q&gt; she replies. "
    
    isActive = !getActor.proper
;
</pre></div>

<p>One further point. We said above that this QueryTopic would respond to ASK WHAT HER NAME IS or WHAT IS YOUR NAME, but what happens if the player types WHAT'S YOUR NAME? It turns out that we don't need to worry about this, since the library will expand the WHAT'S into WHAT IS before attempting to match the grammar. It doesn't do this for everything, just for input that looks like it might be trying to match a QueryTopic, but it does mean that when we're defining the vocab for a QueryTopic we don't need to worry about the player using the qtype word ('who', 'what', 'why', 'when', 'where' or 'how') with apostrophe-s; so long as we've included 'is' among our vocab words our QueryTopic will cope just fine.</p>

<p>Another question we wanted to be able to ask Angela is whether she enjoys her work. Given the plot of this story, the answer she gives is likely to be dependent on what ActorState she's in, so we might want to define different QueryTopics for different ActorStates. Since it will then be used by several QueryTopics it's probably worth defining a separate Topic object for this:</p>

<p><div class="code"><pre>
tEnjoyWork: Topic 'she enjoys her work; you enjoy your like likes; job';
</pre></div>

<p>Here the name section 'she enjoys her work' provides the text for a suggestion like 'ask if she enjoys her work', while the rest of the vocab allows for alternative phrasings like DO YOU LIKE YOUR JOB. The adv3Lite parser recognizes questions beginning DO as equivalent to commands beginning ASK IF, so we only need to supply the words that might follow DO.</p>

<p>We can then go ahead and define the QueryTopic that might be located in the angelaGreetingState:</p>

 <p><div class="code"><pre>
++ QueryTopic 'if|whether' @tEnjoyWork
   "&lt;q&gt;Do you enjoy your work?&lt;/q&gt; you ask.\b
   &lt;q&gt;Of course, sir,&lt;/q&gt; she replies with a bland smile. "    
;
</pre></div>

<p>Note how here we define the qtype part as  'if|whether'. This means that QueryTopic will respond either to ASK IF... or ASK WHETHER..., since the two phrasing could be used with the same meaning.</p>

<p>Here's the version of the QueryTopic we might locate in angelaTalkingState, which is the state Angela will be in if the player character talks with her on the Jetway while she's assisting the passengers who have just been forced off the plane.</p>

 <p><div class="code"><pre>
++ QueryTopic 'if|whether' @tEnjoyWork
   "&lt;q&gt;Do you enjoy your work -- at times like these?&lt;/q&gt; you ask.\b
   &lt;q&gt;At times like these...&lt;/q&gt; she leaves the sentence unfinished with an
   expressive grimace. "    
;
</pre></div>

<p>And this is the version we might locate under the angelaSeatedState (when the plane has been taken over by the drug barons):</p>

 <p><div class="code"><pre>
++ QueryTopic 'if|whether' @tEnjoyWork
    "&lt;q&gt;Are you enjoying your work now?&lt;/q&gt; you ask.\b
    &lt;q&gt;I'll be glad when this particular flight is over,&lt;/q&gt; she replies
    quietly. "       
;
</pre></div>

<p>The third personal question we suggested the player character might put to Angela is what she's doing tonight. The answer might vary a bit according to circumstances: we'll suppose she'll give a different answer once the player character boards the plane wearing a pilot's uniform from what she says before. To implement this we can locate one QueryTopic directly in the angela object to represent her earlier reply, and another in angelaSeatedState which will take precedence towards the end of the game. First the more general answer to be located directly in angela:</p>

 <p><div class="code"><pre>
+ QueryTopic, StopEventList 'what' @tDoingTonight
    [
        '&lt;q&gt;What are you doing tonight?&lt;/q&gt; you ask.\b
        She cocks one eyebrow at you. &lt;q&gt;I have my plans,&lt;/q&gt; she replies
        vaguely. ',
        
        '&lt;q&gt;What &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; you doing tonight?&lt;/q&gt; you insist.\b
        &lt;q&gt;I don\'t think that\'s any of your business,&lt;/q&gt; she replies, with
        rather a bleak smile. &lt;q&gt;Do you?&lt;/q&gt; ',
        
        '&lt;q&gt;About tonight...&lt;/q&gt; you begin.\b
        She cuts you off by pressing her lips together and raising her eyebrows
        in a mildly disapproving manner, as if to say, &lt;q&gt;That topic is
        closed.&lt;/q&gt; '       
    ]
;
</pre></div>

<p>And then the QueryTopic to be located in angelaSeatedState (i.e. once the drug cartel has replaced the regular passengers and the player character returns to the plane wearing a pilot's uniform).</p>

 <p><div class="code"><pre>
++ QueryTopic, StopEventList 'what' @tDoingTonight
    [
        '&lt;q&gt;What are your plans for tonight now?&lt;/q&gt; you ask.\b
        &lt;q&gt;I\'m not sure,&lt;/q&gt; she replies, just a little nervously. &lt;q&gt;I think
        I\'d rather wait until this plane has safely landed at its destination
        and -- well, you know.&lt;/q&gt; She indicates the new set of passengers with a
        flick of her eyes. &lt;q&gt;I think I\'d rather wait until this is all over
        before making any further plans.&lt;/q&gt; ',
        
        '&lt;q&gt;About later tonight...&lt;/q&gt; you begin.\b
        &lt;q&gt;Let\'s discuss it when we\'ve arrived at the other end,&lt;/q&gt; she
        insists. '
    ]
;
</pre></div>

<p>For either of these to work, we also have to define the Topic object they both use:</p>

 <p><div class="code"><pre>
tDoingTonight: Topic 'she\'s doing tonight; she is you are';
</pre></div>

<p>There's one final QueryTopic we could add at this point. The question asked about flight departures is 'When is this plane going to leave?' which suggests a QueryTopic like this:</p>

 <p><div class="code"><pre>
+ QueryTopic 'when' 'this plane is going to leave; depart take off'
    "&lt;q&gt;When is this plane going to leave?&lt;/q&gt; you ask.\b
    &lt;q&gt;Just as soon as the pilot comes aboard,&lt;/q&gt; she tells you. &lt;.reveal
    pilot-awaited&gt; "
;
</pre></div>

<p>The problem with this, however, is that it effectively duplicates the existing AskTopic for tFlightDepartures. What we'd ideally like is a single TopicEntry that can respond in the same way to either ASK ABOUT FLIGHT DEPARTURES or ASK WHEN THE PLANE IS GOING TO LEAVE. We can do that by deleting the AskTopic, retaining the QueryTopic, and adding <span class="code">askMatchObj = tFlightDepartures</span> to the definition of the QueryTopic. This tells the QueryTopic that it should also behave like an AskTopic that matches tFlightDepartures:</p>

 <p><div class="code"><pre>
+ QueryTopic 'when' 'this plane is going to leave; depart take off'
    "&lt;q&gt;When is this plane going to leave?&lt;/q&gt; you ask.\b
    &lt;q&gt;Just as soon as the pilot comes aboard,&lt;/q&gt; she tells you. &lt;.reveal
    pilot-awaited&gt; "
    
    <strong>askMatchObj = tFlightDepartures</strong>
;
</pre></div>

<p>Actually, what it does behind the scenes is a bit more complex than that, but we don't need to worry about the technicalities for now. In essence, it makes the game <em>behave</em> as if the QueryTopic were also an AskTopic matching tFlightDepartures.</p>

<br>
<h2>Tying it All Together</h2>

<p>We've now achieved part of what we set out to do, but not all of it. Our original aim was to have ASK WOMAN ABOUT HERSELF to suggest three further topics, namely "ask her what her name is", "ask if she enjoys her work" and "ask what she's doing tonight", but as we have things so far the QueryTopics we've defined are quite unrelated to the AskTopic for ASK HER ABOUT HERSELF. The way to relate them is through the <strong>convKeys</strong> property. This simply consists of an arbitrary string (or a list of arbitrary strings) that we can use to group and refer to TopicEntries and groups of TopicEntries. To make one TopicEntry suggest a number of other ones we need to define the <strong>keyTopics</strong> property of the suggesting TopicEntry to be the same as the convKeys property (or at least one of the strings in the convKeys list) of the TopicEntries to be suggested.</p>

<p>In this case let's call the convKey we want to use 'angela'. It could be anything we liked, but this seems a meaningful name for a set of topics that relate to Angela herself. We then need to define keyTopics = 'angela' on the 'ask her about herself' AskTopic, and convKeys = 'angela' on the QueryTopics for ASK WHAT HER NAME IS, ASK IF SHE ENJOYS HER JOB and ASK WHAT SHE'S DOING TONIGHT:</p>

 <p><div class="code"><pre>
+ AskTopic @angela
    keyTopics = 'angela'
    
    name = 'herself'
;

+ QueryTopic 'what' 'her name is; your'
    "&lt;q&gt;What's your name?&lt;/q&gt; you ask.\b
    &lt;q&gt;&lt;&lt;getActor.makeProper&gt;&gt;,&lt;/q&gt; she replies. "
    
    isActive = !getActor.proper
    
    convKeys = 'angela'
;

+ QueryTopic, StopEventList 'what' @tDoingTonight
    [
        '&lt;q&gt;What are you doing tonight?&lt;/q&gt; you ask.\b
        She cocks one eyebrow at you. &lt;q&gt;I have my plans,&lt;/q&gt; she replies
        vaguely. ',
        
        '&lt;q&gt;What &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; you doing tonight?&lt;/q&gt; you insist.\b
        &lt;q&gt;I don\'t think that\'s any of your business,&lt;/q&gt; she replies, with
        rather a bleak smile. &lt;q&gt;Do you?&lt;/q&gt; ',
        
        '&lt;q&gt;About tonight...&lt;/q&gt; you begin.\b
        She cuts you off by pressing her lips together and raising her eyebrows
        in a mildly disapproving manner, as if to say, &lt;q&gt;That topic is
        closed.&lt;/q&gt; '       
    ]
    
    convKeys = 'angela'
;
</pre></div>

<p>And so on for the other QueryTopics we've defined that relate to what Angela's doing tonight or whether she enjoys her work.</p>

<p>This almost does what we want, but perhaps not quite, for when the player types TOPICS at the start of the first conversation with Angela, the three QueryTopics that are meant to be listed as a result of asking Angela about herself are listed alongside "You could ask when this plane is leaving, or ask her about herself". If we want the topic suggestions to act like a kind ot two-tier menu, with only the main topics appearing in response to a TOPICS command, and the subtopics only appearing in response to a command like ASK ANGELA ABOUT HERSELF, then we need to carry out a couple of extra steps. First we need to define the <strong>suggestionKey</strong> property of the actor to hold a convKey used on the top-level TopicEntries. Again, this can be anything we like, but let's call it 'top':</p>

 <p><div class="code"><pre>
angela: Actor 'flight attendant; statuesque young; woman angela; her'
    @planeFront
    "She's a statuesque and by no means unattractive young woman. "
    
    checkAttackMsg = 'That would be cruel and unnecessary. '
    
    globalParamName = 'angela'
    
    makeProper
    {
        proper = true;
        name = 'Angela';
        return name;
    }
    
    suggestionKey = 'top'
;
</pre></div>

<p>Now the TOPICS command will only list those TopicEntries whose convKeys include 'top'. We thus need to give a convKey of 'top' to the ASK ABOUT HERSELF and ASK ABOUT PILOT AskTopic, and the ASK WHEN THIS PLANE IS LEAVING QueryTopic. We could do this by adding <span class="code">convKeys = 'top'</span> to each of these in turn, but we can save a bit of typing (and perhaps make out intentions a bit clearer) by putting these three TopicEntries together in the same TopicGroup and defining the convKeys property on the TopicGroup:</p>

 <p><div class="code"><pre>
+ TopicGroup 'top';

++ AskTopic @angela
    keyTopics = 'angela'
    
    name = 'herself'
;

++ QueryTopic 'when' 'this plane is going to leave; depart take off'
    "&lt;q&gt;When is this plane going to leave?&lt;/q&gt; you ask.\b
    &lt;q&gt;Just as soon as the pilot comes aboard,&lt;/q&gt; she tells you. &lt;.reveal
    pilot-awaited&gt; "
    
    askMatchObj = tFlightDepartures
;


++ AskTopic @tPilot
    "&lt;q&gt;What's happened to the pilot?&lt;/q&gt; you ask.\b
    &lt;q&gt;I don't know; we're still waiting for him,&lt;/q&gt; she replies. &lt;q&gt;But don't
    worry; I'm sure he'll turn up any moment now.&lt;/q&gt; "

    autoName = true
    isActive = gRevealed('pilot-awaited')
;
</pre></div>

<p>If after all this you're beginning to lose track of what TopicEntry should go where, you can take a look at the <a href="convsumm.htm#listing">listing</a> at the end of the chapter. If  you're starting to feel that what we've just covered seems a bit elaborate and complicated, don't worry: no one could expect you take it all in after this rather brief introduction, and you don't have to use any of these techniques in your own work if you don't want to (although mastering them may help you create more lifelike NPCs). The main point here has been to illustrate some of the things you can do with the adv3Lite conversation system. If you want to learn more about what we've just covered, or when you need to refresh your own memory to apply similar techniques in your own work, you can always consult the <em>adv3Lite Library Manual</em>, particularly the sections on <a href="../manual/suggest.htm">Suggesting Conversational Topics</a>, <a href="../manual/specialtopic.htm">Special Topics</a> and <a href="../manual/topicgroup.htm">Topic Groups</a>. We shall in any case be meeting many of these concepts again in the remainder of this chapter.</p>
