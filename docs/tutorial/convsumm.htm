<h1>Summary</h1>

<p>We've now taken the Angela NPC as far as we need to for the purposes of this tutorial, though she's not really complete (try asking her about flight departures and the pilot after the player character's made it clear he intends to fly the plane, for example; the exchanges are then rather incongruous). We could certainly add a bit more polish, and we might want to extend her conversational range, but these can be left as exercises for the interested reader (they might be quite useful exercises if you want more practice at using the adv3Lite conversation system).</p>

<p>As you'll see from the <a href="#listing">listing below</a>, the code for Angela has already become quite complex. This is inevitable if you want to implement an NPC of any sophistication. Writing even a reasonable approximation to realistic conversation in IF is a lot of work; an authoring system can provide you with the tools for the job, but it can't do the work for you. What adv3Lite does do (following principles borrowed from adv3) is to allow you to program conversations in a largely declarative style spread over a large number of objects. This avoids spaghetti coding with lots of if-branches and case statements, and makes your code easier to write, read and maintain. If you read through the complete listing below you'll see there's actually very little procedural code; it's mainly a matter of defining objects and their properties. This makes it about as easy for you as an IF conversation system can make it.</p>

<p>That said, there's no getting away from the fact that the conversation system in adv3Lite is quite complex; it is easily the most complex part of the library. But it is also scalable, which means you don't have to use all the complexity if you don't want to; you can just use the bits you need for your own particular game. We should also add that although we've covered most of the main features of the adv3Lite conversation system in this chapter, we haven't covered them all. The system is intended to be highly flexible to allow you to write the kinds of conversation you want to write. You don't have to follow the coding patterns illustrated in this chapter, although they'll often prove useful.</p>

<p>Probably the next step is for you to read through the entire <a href="../manual/actor.htm">Actors</a> part of the <em>adv3Lite Library Manual</em> to refresh your memory and see what else is there, and then perhaps (or in parallel, perhaps) try increasing Angela's conversational range a bit more. In the meantime, here's a brief summary of what we've covered (and what we've missed) in this chapter, with links to the relevant sections of the <em>adv3Lite Library Manual</em>.</p>

<p>At its simplest, conversation in adv3Lite can be implemented as a <a href="../manual/asktell.htm">Basic Ask/Tell system</a> using various kinds of <a href="../manual/actortopicentry.htm">TopicEntry</a> objects (such as AskTopic and TellTopic). If you like, you can <a href="../manual/suggest.htm">suggest</a> certain topics of conversation to the player by giving your TopicEntries a <span class="code">name</span> property. The availability of TopicEntries to respond to the player's conversation commands depends on a number of factors, including which <a href="../manual/actorstate.htm">ActorState</a> the NPC is in, the <span class="code">isActive</span> property of the TopicEntry and the <span class="code">convKeys</span> property, which can be used for a variety of purposes. Where several TopicEntries share the same values of these properties it can be useful to group them under a common <a href="../manual/topicgroup.htm">TopicGroup</a>.</p>

<p>There are various ways you can make things more elaborate. A <a href="../manual/specialtopic.htm#saytopic">SayTopic</a> allows the player character to say just about anything to an NPC (within reason!), while a <a href="../manual/specialtopic.htm#querytopic">QueryTopic</a> allows the player character to ask a wide range of much more specific questions than is possible with an AskTopic (users familiar with adv3 might like to know that there is no restriction on where these two types of TopicEntry may be used, unlike an adv3 SpecialTopic). A particular point in the conversation at which particular responses or questions become momentarily appropriate is called a <a href="../manual/convnode.htm">Conversation Node</a> and can be most conveniently implemented using a combination of a <span class="code">ConvNode</span> object and a <span class="code">&lt;.convnode&gt;</span> tag. In many situations it is also appropriate to implement <a href="../manual/hello.htm">Greeting Protocols</a>, whereby conversations are properly begun and ended with some equivalent of "hello" and "goodbye" and the NPC can optionally change between conversational and non-conversational ActorStates. </p>

<p>In order to ensure that a conversational exchange remains sensible and appropriate, it's often necessary to keep track of what both the player character and the NPC s/he's talking to currently know. Player Character and NPC <a href="../manual/knowledge.htm">Knowledge</a> can be tracked using <span class="code">&lt;.reveal key&gt;</span> and <span class="code">&lt;.inform key&gt;</span> tags, and tested with <span class="code">gRevealed(key)</span> and <span class="code">gInformed(key</span>), typically used on the isActive property of a TopicEntry (or perhaps a TopicGroup).</p>

<p>A couple of topics we only touched on were <a href="../manual/orders.htm">Giving Orders to NPCs</a> (e.g. BOB, PUT THE BALL IN THE BOX) and <a href="../manual/initiate.htm">NPC-Initiated Conversation</a>. Orders given to NPCs are typically handled by <span class="code">CommandTopics</span> and <span class="code">DefaultCommandTopics</span>, which are similar in principle to other TopicEntries but can be a little more complex to specify. One way we've seen for an NPC to initiate a conversation is via a <a href="../manual/initiate.htm#convagendaitem">ConvAgendaItem</a>. Another, which we didn't cover, might be through an <a href="../manual/initiate.htm#initiatetopic">InitiateTopic</a>. A particularly sophisticated technique (which again we haven't covered in this tutorial) is to combine a <span class="code">ConvAgendaItem</span> with a <a href="../manual/initiate.htm#defaultagenda">DefaultAgendaTopic</a>, which allows an NPC to pursue his or her own conversational agenda instead of giving a canned default response when the player tries a conversational command that hasn't otherwise been specifically catered for; instead of giving a disguised version of "I haven't been programmed to respond in that area", the NPC can take the opportunity to seize the conversational initiative.</p>

<p>Finally, we have met a number of tags that can be used in conversation, such as <.reveal>, but there are several more that we haven't covered in this tutorial that can be used for a variety of purposes. A full list is provided in the <a href="../manual/actoroverview.htm">NPC Overview</a> section of the manual.</p>
