<h2>Single and Double-Quoted Strings</h2>

<p>There's just one more topic we need to consider before we return to <em>The Adventures of Heidi</em>. Another name for a work of Interactive Fiction is a Text Adventure, and, as the name implies, whether or not a particular work of Interactive Fiction really constitutes an adventure, it will certainly involve a lot of text. In the discussion so far we have seen quite a lot of text included in code, some of it between single quote marks 'like this', and some of it between double quote marks "like this". In TADS 3 (and hence in adv3Lite) the distinction between the two is important, and to distinguish between the two they are referred to respectively as single-quoted strings and double-quoted strings:</p>

 <p><div class="code"><pre>
'This is a single-quoted string.';
"This is a double-quoted string.";
</pre></div>

<p>The basic distinction between the two is relatively straightforward: a single-quoted string is a piece of textual data that can be assigned to a property or variable, passed as the argument to a function or method, and manipulated in all sorts of interesting ways (such as extracting parts of the string, or changing parts of it, or changing its case, or searching it for the presence of a sub-string), whereas a double-quoted string is simply an instruction to the game to display the text it contains (as we saw in the discussion of the <a href="methods.htm#dquote">double-quoted string statement</a> above).</p>

<p>This apparently simple distinction is, however, apparently blurred by the fact that some object properties are defined as single-quoted strings and others as double-quoted strings, as, for example, in the typical definition of a Thing where the <span class="code">vocab</span> property is single-quoted string and the <span class="code">desc</span> property a double-quoted string:</p>

 <p><div class="code"><pre>
+ bird: Thing 'baby bird;;nestling'
    "Too young to fly, the nestling tweets helplessly. "
    
    bulk = 1
;
</pre></div>

<p>The distinction isn't too badly blurred here. The <span class="code">vocab</span> property ('baby bird;;nestling', via the template) is one that the library has to do quite a bit of further manipulation with in order to extract the name property and the nouns and adjectives that can be used to refer to the bird. On the other hand the desc property ("Too young to fly, the nestling tweets helplessly. ", via the template) is something that's displayed when the bird is examined. Indeed, a double-quoted string property is always in effect an instruction to display some text, almost (though not quite) equivalent to a method that displays some text. Indeed, it would have been perfectly legal (though in this case pointless) to define the bird object thus:</p>

<p><div class="code"><pre>
+ bird: Thing 'baby bird;;nestling'
    desc() { "Too young to fly, the nestling tweets helplessly. "; }
    
    bulk = 1
;
</pre></div>

<p>In fact, wherever the library requires a double-quoted string property, it's always legal (and sometimes useful) to supply a method that displays some text instead. It becomes useful when the text we want to display varies according to complex conditions (we'll see an example below) so it's convenient to write a method with lots of <span class="code">if</span> statements rather than trying to cram all the possibilities into a double-quoted string with lots of embedded expressions. From the point of view of the player, the two definitions of the bird object will appear to act exactly the same.</p>

<p>Thus, as a first approximation, we can say that a double-quoted string property is really more like a short-hand method than a piece of data (just as a double-quoted string statement is a convenient means to display some text rather than an expression that can be assigned to anything), and as a first approximation that's probably not a bad way to think about it, although as we shall see below there are some subtle differences between a double-quoted string property and a method that uses precisely the same double-quoted string to display some text; internally to the compiler they are two different things, and in certain contexts that can affect what you can do with them.</p>

<p>For the sake of completeness we should mention at this point that it's also legal to use a method that returns a single-quoted string instead of a simple single-quoted string; the method and the single-quoted string remain rather different kinds of programming entity nevertheless.</p>

<p>When you first encounter adv3Lite (or TADS 3) it may at first sight seem a bit arbitrary which text-containing properties are single-quoted strings and which are double-quoted. As a rough rule of thumb, double-quoted string properties tend to be complete sentences or even longer pieces of text that will always be displayed just as they are, whereas single-quoted strings are typically shorter sentence fragments, or just names or adjectives or verbs that will be used to build up complete sentences for display and which may be manipulated further in different ways. But there are a whole lot of properties ending in msg (such as <span class="code">cannotTakeMsg</span>) which for reasons that need not detain us right now are defined as single-quoted strings yet consist of complete sentences. A second rule of thumb is that properties whose name ends in desc (such as <span class="code">desc</span>, <span class="code">specialDesc</span>,  and <span class="code">initSpecialDesc</span>) tend to be double-quoted strings (because they contain complete descriptions, but here again there are some exceptions: <span class="code">stateDesc</span> is a single-quoted string (because it's only ever meant to be part of a description and it can easily change), while <span class="code">readDesc</span>, <span class="code">smellDesc</span>, <span class="code">tasteDesc</span>, <span class="code">feelDesc</span> and <span class="code">listenDesc</span> are allowed to be either single-quoted or double-quoted strings (so that they'll work okay whichever way you define them). So although these rules of thumb may have some use, in the end you just have to get used to knowing which kind of string is used for which property. (Actually, the library attempts to be as fault-tolerant as possible over whether you define certain properties as single-quoted or double-quoted string, but you are urged not to rely on this, since some properties have to be one or the other).</p>

<p>One important thing to realize is that though a property definition may superficially resemble an assignment statement, the two are quite different things. That means that while the following definition is legal:</p>

<p><div class="code"><pre>
+ bird: Thing 'baby bird;;nestling'
    desc = "Too young to fly, the nestling tweets helplessly. "   
;
</pre></div>

<p>The following statement is not:</p>

 <p><div class="code"><pre>
bird.desc = "The nestling looks calmer now. "; <font color=red><strong>// DON'T DO THIS!</strong></font>
</pre></div>

<p>You <em>cannot</em> assign a double-quoted string directly to a property or variable (or pass it as a parameter), since a double-quoted string is not a value or an expression, but an instruction to display some text. (There is a way of indirectly assigning a double-quoted string value to a property at run-time, which we'll mention briefly below). The normal way to handle the kind of variation in a description (or other double-quoted string property) is by including conditional statements either in an embedded expression or a method:</p>

<p><div class="code"><pre>
+ bird: Thing 'baby bird;;nestling'
    "&lt;&lt;if isCalm&gt;&gt;The nestling looks calmer now&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;Too young to fly, the nestling tweets helplessly&lt;&lt;end&gt;&gt;. "   
    
    isCalm = nil
;
</pre></div>

<p>Or:</p>

<p><div class="code"><pre>
+ bird: Thing 'baby bird;;nestling'
    desc()
    {
       if(isCalm)
          "The nestling looks calmer now. ";
       else
          "Too young to fly, the nestling tweets helplessly. ";
    
    isCalm = nil
;
</pre></div>

<p>In this relatively simple case, you'd probably prefer the first way. In a more complex case you might well prefer the second.</p>

<p>There is a way of sorts of assigning a new double-quoted string value to a property. Just for the record, it looks like this:</p>

 <p><div class="code"><pre>
bird.setMethod(&amp;desc, 'The nestling looks calmer now. ');
</pre></div>

<p>Conversely, you can get at the current single-quoted string value of a double-quoted string property with a statement like:</p>

 <p><div class="code"><pre>
local str = bird.getMethod(&amp;desc);
</pre></div>

<p>But note that this will only work as expected (a) if desc has been defined as a double-quoted string and not as a method (this is one of the subtle differences between the two) and (b) if the double-quoted string contains no embedded expressions (otherwise it will be treated as a method). These restrictions mean you have to be very careful about using <span class="code">getMethod()</span> to get at the single-quoted string equivalent of a double-quoted string value, and you should probably avoid it (it's not really what <span class="code">getMethod()</span> is for). A more reliable way of achieving the objective would be:</p>

 <p><div class="code"><pre>
local str = gOutStream.captureOutput({ : bird.desc });
</pre></div>

<p>But that's using features way beyond anything we're likely to cover in this tutorial. For now, therefore, I suggest you stick to using the if-statement method (embedded or otherwise) for creating variable descriptions.</p>

<h2>Further Reading</h2>

<p>For the full story on strings, see the section on "String Literals" in Part III of the <em>TADS 3 System Manual</em>. If you're at all unclear about what we've just covered, or you're left feeling you'd like to go into more detail straight away (we certainly didn't cover everything), I suggest you take a look at it now. But if you're reasonably happy and want to carry straight on to the next chapter, that's fine too; only do take the trouble to see what the <em>System Manual</em> has to say about strings at some point.</p>

<p>Incidentally we mentioned more than once that single-quoted strings are data that can be manipulated, but beyond mentioning string concatenation (with the + operator) in a previous part of this chapter, we haven't gone into any detail how. When you're ready to find out, you'll find most of the answers in the section on "String" in Part IV of the <a href="../sysman.htm">TADS 3 System Manual</a>, but that's something you can well afford to leave for now.</p>
<br>

<h2>Afterword</h2>

<p>This chapter has proved to be a bit more than a review of the concepts introduced in the previous one. In the course of the review we have taken the opportunity to introduce a number of new concepts and features to round out the picture. If you've mastered everything in this chapter you're a long way towards acquiring the basic skill set you need to write Interactive Fiction using adv3Lite. If you don't feel you've totally mastered it all yet, not to worry; in the chapters that follow we'll be reinforcing what's been covered here as well as building on it and extending on it to introduce other features of the TADS 3 language and the adv3Lite library you'll probably find useful in your own work. Our next immediate task will be to revisit <em>The Adventures of Heidi</em> and make some improvements.</p>
