<h1>Laying out the map</h1>

<p>In this chapter we'll implement another very simple game, one that's initially even simpler than <em>The Adventures of Heidi</em>, though as we progress we'll improve it in ways that introduce several new features of the adv3Lite library.</p>

<p>The plot of the game could hardly be simpler. An explorer arrives outside the entrance to a cave. Inside he finds a priceless gold skull resting on a stone pedestal. If he takes the skull, however, he springs a trap that kills him instantly. The solution is to place a rock on the pedestal before removing the skull, so that the weight of the rock prevents the springing of the trap. The game is won when the player character heads back to his camp carrying the gold skull.</p>

<p>To start implementing this game you need to carry out the steps listed for creating a new adv3Lite game back in <a href="setting.htm">Chapter 2</a>, substituting 'goldskull' for 'heidi' throughout. Create a new directory/folder for the goldskull project, copy the template files into it, and then rename those with adv3Ltemplate in their name appropriately (i.e. to goldskull but with the same file extension). Then open the source file start.t in the goldskull directory, either using the Workbench editor (in Windows) or some other text editor. Or, if you're using Windows Workbench, simpy use the New Project wizard to create a new adv3Lite project called "goldskull".</p>

<p>To lay out the map we simply need to create an additional room to represent the cave, and three objects: the pedestal, the skull and the rock. There's very little that's new here; this is what the code should look like:</p>

 <p><div class="code"><pre>
#charset "us-ascii"

#include &lt;tads.h&gt;
#include "advlite.h"

versionInfo: GameID
    IFID = '' <span class="comment">// obtain IFID from http://www.tads.org/ifidgen/ifidgen</span>
    name = <strong>'Goldskull'</strong>
    byline = 'by A.N. Author'
    htmlByline = 'by &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:an.author@somemail.com&quot;&gt;
                  A.N. Author&lt;/a&gt;'
    version = '1'
    authorEmail = 'A.N. Author &lt;an.author@somemail.com&gt;'
    desc = 'Your blurb here.'
    htmlDesc = 'Your blurb here.'    
    
;

gameMain: GameMainDef
    <span class="comment">/* Define the initial player character; this is compulsory */</span>
    initialPlayerChar = me
;


<span class="comment">/* The starting location; this can be called anything you like */</span>

startroom: Room 'Outside Cave'
     desc = "You're standing in the bright sunlight just outside of a large,
         dark, foreboding cave, which lies to the north. " 
    <strong>north = cave</strong> 
;
<span class="comment">
/* 
 *   The player character object. This doesn't have to be called me, but me is a
 *   convenient name. If you change it to something else, remember to change
 *   gameMain.initialPlayerChar accordingly.
 */</span>

+ me: Thing 'you'   
   <strong> "You can't see yourself, but you suspect you must look quite a sight after
    traipsing miles through tropical jungle to get here. "</strong>
    
    isFixed = true    
    proper = true
    ownsContents = true
    person = 2   
    contType = Carrier    
;

cave: Room 'Cave'    
    desc = "You're inside a dark and musty cave. Sunlight 
    pours in from a passage to the south. " 

    south = startroom 
;

+ pedestal: Thing 'stone pedestal; smooth'
    "The smooth stone pedestal is artfully positioned to catch the sunlight at
    just this time of day. "
    
    isFixed = true
    contType = On
;

++ goldSkull: Thing 'gold skull;; head'
    "It's the shape and size of a human skull, but made of solid gold; it must
    be worth a fortune. "
;

+ smallRock: Thing 'small rock; round solid'
     "It's roughly round and looks pretty solid. "
;
</pre></div>

<p>Changes to the boiler-plate code already provided are marked in bold to make them easier to see. There's just a couple of things to note here. First, we've added a description to the me object so that there's a meaningfull non-default response to EXAMINE ME. Second, note the two + signs in front of the <span class="code">goldSkull</span> object, to indicate that it's located on the pedestal, which is itself located in the cave. Note also that since the <span class="code">smallRock</span> object has only one plus sign, it's in the cave, not on the pedestal. Finally, recall that defining <span class="code">contType = On</span> on the pedestal makes it something its contents rest <em>on</em> (rather than in, under or behind).</p>

<p>If you try compiling and running the game now you should be able to move between the two rooms and move the skull and the rock around, but that's about it. In the next section we'll make a few more things happen, but for now it's probably worth trying out what you've got so far just to make sure it all works.</p>
