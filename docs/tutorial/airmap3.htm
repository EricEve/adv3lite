<h1>Aboard the Plane</h1>

<h2>Preparations</h2>

<p>We'll put the map of the plane in another source separate file, so start by adding a file to your project called plane.t (if you can't remember how to do this, refer to the instructions at the start of the <a href="airmap2.htm">previous section</a>). Remember to make sure you new source file begins with:</p>

 <p><div class="code"><pre>
#charset "us-ascii"

#include &lt;tads.h&gt;
#include "advlite.h"
</pre></div>

<p>For the moment we'll stick to a fairly skeletal layout. There'll be plenty of complications to add later, especially in the cockpit. We will do a couple of new things, however. First, since all the rooms we're about to define have in common that they're aboard an airplane/aeroplane, we'll assign them to a common <strong>Region</strong>, which we'll call planeRegion. We'll start out by defining the Region itself:</p>

 <p><div class="code"><pre>
planeRegion: Region
;
</pre></div>

<p>That's all there is to it; it's up to rooms to say what regions they belong to (by listing them in their <span class="code">regions</span> property), not to regions to say what rooms they contain (actually that's not quite true; internally the game keeps note of what rooms each region contains, but game authors don't have to define it, since it's all taken care of automatically; all we have to define is what regions each room belongs to). A Region is simply a way of grouping rooms that have something significant in common. At first sight this may not seem all that useful, but we'll demonstrate a couple of uses for it by the time we reach the end of this section. If you're anxious to know more about them, you can read about <a href="../manual/room.htm#regions">regions</a> in the <em>Adv3Lite Library Manual</em>.</p>

<p>Since all the rooms we're about to define are aboard a plane, the other thing we'll do a bit differently is use shipboard directions (port, starboard, fore and aft) to interconnect them, though we'll also provide compass directions as silent synonyms.</p>

<h2>Laying out the map</h2>

<p>Here's our initial skeletal layout for the plane:</p>

 <p><div class="code"><pre>
cockpit: Room 'Cockpit' 'cockpit'
    
    aft = planeFront
    south asExit(aft)
    out asExit(aft)
    
    regions = [planeRegion]
;

planeFront: Room 'Front of Plane' 'front[n] of the plane;;airplane aeroplane'
    "The main aisle comes to an end at the port exit of the plane, but continues
    aft past the seating. A little further forward is a door that &lt;&lt;unless
      me.hasSeen(cockpit)&gt;&gt;presumably&lt;&lt;end&gt;&gt; leads into the cockpit. "
    
    fore = cockpit
    north asExit(fore)
    port = jetway
    west asExit(port)
    out asExit(port)
    aft = planeRear
    south asExit(aft)
    
    regions = [planeRegion]
;


planeRear: Room 'Rear of Plane' 'rear[n] of the plane;;airplane aeroplane'
    "The main aisle continue forward to the front of the plane and aft to the
    bathroom between rows of red coloured seats. "
    fore = planeFront
    north asExit(fore)
    aft = bathroom
    south asExit(aft)
    
    regions = [planeRegion]    
;


bathroom: Room 'Bathroom' 'bathroom;;loo lavatory toilet wc cubicle'
    "The bathroom is just a tiny cubicle with all the standard fittings you'd
    expect. "
    
    fore = planeRear
    north asExit(fore)
    out asExit(fore)    
    
    regions = [planeRegion] 
;

+ Decoration 'fittings; wash; washbasin basin taps faucets bowl; them'
     "At least the washbasin and the bowl look reasonably clean. "
    
    notImportantMsg = 'You have no need to make use of any of these facilities
        right now. '
;

+ bucket: Container 'bucket; plain yellow plastic; pail'
    "It's just a plain yellow plastic bucket. "
    initSpecialDesc = "Some cleaner seems to have left all his things here:
        &lt;&lt;list of location.listableContents.subset({x: x.moved == nil})&gt;&gt;. "
    
;

+ sponge: Thing 'sponge; turquoise'
    "It's a kind of turquoise colour. "
;

+ garbageBag: Container 'garbage bag; large green plastic rubbish; bag'
    "It's basically just a large green plastic bag. "
;

+ brassKey: Thing 'small brass key; yale'
    "It's just like all the other yale keys you've ever seen. "    
;
</pre></div>

<p>There's only a couple of things to remark on here. The first is the use of <span class="code">"A little further forward is a door that &lt;&lt;unless me.hasSeen(cockpit)&gt;&gt;presumably&lt;&lt;end&gt;&gt; leads into the cockpit."</span> The purpose of this is to get rid of the word 'presumably' once the player character has visited the cockpit, since he then knows for certain where the door leads. One way to test this is to check whether the player character has seen the cockpit, which we can do with <span class="code">me.hasSeen(cockpit)</span>. Since we want the word 'presumably' to appear only if the player character <em>hasn't</em> seen the cockpit we use <span class="code">&lt;&lt;unless <em>cond</em>&gt;&gt;</span> rather than <span class="code">&lt;&lt;if <em>cond</em>&gt;&gt;</span>, so that what follows is displayed if <em>cond</em> is <em>false</em>.</p>

<p>The second point of note is the use of <span class="code">&lt;&lt;list of location.listableContents.subset({x: x.moved == nil})&gt;&gt;</span> in the initSpecialDesc of the bucket object. We've met the <span class="code">&lt;&lt;list of&gt;&gt;</span> construct before, as a means of controlling how a list of items is presented to the player. You may recall that anything list by <span class="code">&lt;&lt; list of <em>lst</em> &gt;&gt;</span> is marked as mentioned so it isn't mentioned again in the room description object listing. It's the expression <span class="code"> location.listableContents.subset({x: x.moved == nil})</span> that may look a bit strange. What it does is to provide a list of all the listable items directly in the location that haven't yet been moved. If you like you can think of it as equivalent to a hypothetical <span class="code">&lt;&lt;list of unMoved(location.listableContents)&gt;&gt;</span> where <span class="code">unMoved()</span> would be defined as:</p>

 <p><div class="code"><pre>
 unMoved(lst)
 {
     local ret = [];
     for(local item in lst)
     {
        if(!item.moved)
           ret += item;
     }
     
     return ret;
 }
 </pre></div>

 <p>The rather odd expression <span class="code">location.listableContents.subset({x: x.moved == nil})</span> is basically just a shorthand means of doing that; if it looks a bit daunting, don't worry about it too much for now; it does make use of some of the more advanced features of the TADS 3 language. If you are curious to know more about it you'll need to look at a couple of the sections of the <em>TADS 3 System Manual</em>: "Anonymous Functions" in Part III and "List" in Part IV, but you can certainly afford to leave that for now.</p>
 
<p>One further point is that we define the bathroom fittings as a single Decoration object that discourages much interaction. The purpose of the game isn't to build a full simulation of everything mentioned, and we don't need a fully-functional toilet simulation here. Quite apart from anything else we don't want to give the player any opportunity to fill the bucket with water, which could cause all sorts of unwelcome complications.</p>

<h2>How to be in several places at once</h2>

<p>The plane's seating is mentioned both at the front and the rear of the place, but we've yet to implement it. It's not something the player really needs to interact with in the game, so we can afford to give it a fairly minimalist definition. Also, there's no particular reason why the seating at the front of the plane should be any different from that at the rear (we're not really interested in distinguishing first class from economy class in this game, for example). Rather than define essentially the same object twice and put it in two different locations, we'll therefore take a shortcut and define the seating only once but put it in both locations. We can do that by means of the <strong>MultiLoc</strong> class:</p>


<p><div class="code"><pre> 
MultiLoc, Decoration 'seats; red airline; seating seat; them'
    "Like all airline seats, these ones look like they were designed for the
    average-sized person of a century and a half ago. "
    
    notImportantMsg = 'All the seats round here seem to be taken, so you\'d best
        leave them alone. '
    
    locationList = [planeFront, planeRear]
;
</pre></div> 

<p>There's a few points to note here. First of all, MultiLoc is what is known as a <em>mix-in</em> class. This means it must come first in the list of classes when you define the object; as a general rule classes that are not derived from Thing should always precede classes that are.</p>

<p>Second, since the whole point of a MultiLoc is to be in several places at once, you can't define its initial location using the + syntax or the location property. Instead you define its <strong>locationList</strong> as here to contain the list of rooms (and/or regions) in which the MultiLoc is initially located.</p>

<p>Third, you need to be a bit careful what you use a MultiLoc for, since when you define one you do actually end up with precisely the same object in more than one location, which could produce quite odd effects if the player is able to have any significant interactions with it. Usually, then, it's best to restrict the use of MultiLocs to Decoration or Distant items (as here), unless the MultiLoc you're defining really is meant to represent the same physical object straddling the boundary of two or more rooms (like the fountain at the centre of a square, say, when the square itself is represented as four different locations). So, MultiLocs are best restricted to:</p>

<ol>
<li>Represent the same object seen from a number of different rooms (for example, the sun, moon or sky, or a distant mountain).</li>
<li>Represent a number of identical objects that occur in more than one location (trees in a forest, say, or the floor of a house) but which are treated purely as decorations (the player can examine them, and maybe feel them, smell them, and listen to them, but that should usually be it; normally no interaction that might change the game state should be permitted with MultiLocs of this sort).</li>
<li>Represent the same object straddling the boundary of two or more rooms, for example the fountain at the centre of a square. In this case, more elaborate interactions are permissible, for example tossing a coin into the fountain from the northeast corner of the square and retrieving the same coin from the same fountain in the southwest corner.</li>
</ol>

<p>The full story on <a href="../manual/multiloc.htm">MultiLocs</a> can be found in the <em>adv3Lite Library Manual</em>.</p>

<p>Armed with these provisos, we can define a second MultiLoc to provide a minimalist representation of the passengers on the plane. This time we'll name the object since we'll later want to remove these passengers from the plane. </p> 
 
<p><div class="code"><pre> 
airlinePassengers: MultiLoc, Decoration 'passengers;;men women; them'
    "You sense an air of impatience about them, as if they're all wondering when
    the aircraft is finally going to leave. "
    
    notImportantMsg = 'Better leave them alone; you don\'t want to draw
        attention to yourself. ' 
    
    locationList = [planeFront, planeRear]
;
</pre></div>
 

<h2>Making Use of the Region</h2>

<p>Earlier on we promised we'd show a couple of uses for regions. The time has come to make good on that promise. One thing we can do with a region is test whether something is in it by using <span class="code">isIn()</span> just as we can for rooms and other things. The expression <span class="code">obj.isIn(<em>reg</em>)</span> is true if obj is in any of the rooms in <em>reg</em> (where <em>reg</em> is a region). Now let's see how we can use that in practice.</p>

<p>You'll recall that we set up an object to provide a number of announcements over the airport's public address system. It's likely these announcements wouldn't be audible aboard the plane, so we can use <span class="code">me.isIn(planeRegion)</span> to silence the announcements when the player character is aboard the plane:</p>

 <p><div class="code"><pre>
announcementObj: ShuffledEventList
    ...
    <strong>announce()
    {
        if(!me.isIn(planeRegion))
           doScript();
    }</strong>
    
    prefix = 'An announcement comes over the public address system: '
;
</pre></div>

<p>Secondly, we used shipboard directions (port, starboard, fore and aft) as directions of travel aboard the plane, but they're not very meaningful anywhere else. In a previous chapter we saw how to use a Doer to block the use of these directions altogether. Now we can define one that block them <em>except</em> aboard the plane (i.e. in the planeRegion):</p>


<p><div class="code"><pre>
Doer 'go dir'
    exec(c)
    {
        "Shipboard directions don't have much meaning here. ";
        abort;
    }
    
    direction = [portDir, starboardDir, foreDir, aftDir]
    when = (!me.isIn(planeRegion))
;</pre></div>

<p>The <span class="code">when</span> property of a Doer can be used to specify any condition we please, and the Doer only takes effect when it evaluates to true.</p>

<p>This would be a good point at which to try compiling and running the game again to ensure that everything works as expected.</p>
