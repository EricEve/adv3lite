<h1>What More?</h1>

<h2>What More Might Go in the Airport Game?</h2>

<p>We've taken the Airport game as far as we need to for the purposes of this tutorial, and it can now be played through from beginning to end, but it's not exactly finished in the sense of being a fully-polished product. Quite apart from finishing off the scoring and the hints and maybe broadening the range of conversational responses there's quite a bit more that could be done if you wanted to practise your adv3Lite skills on it. For example, the description of the power cable running off from the metal detector mentions a desk, but we haven't implemented the desk. In a properly polished game there should at least be a Decoration object to represent it. Then there's the issue of where the original passengers from the plane disappear to once the player dons the pilot's uniform; perhaps they'd all go to the snack bar? The room description for the gate3 room is certainly inappropriate once the original passengers have been booted off the plane, so ideally it should be made to change according to circumstances. And why is Passenger Quixote always called to the information desk? Might we want to arrange for the name to be varied?</p>

<p>Again, more could be done with flying the plane. What happens if the player character leaves the cockpit to go and chat to Angela again while the plane is careering down the runway? Should we take steps to prevent this happening (perhaps by not allowing the player character to leave his seat while the plane is in motion?). Should Angela join the player character in the cockpit, perhaps, and what might happen if she does? Should it be necessary for the player character to take more precautions against the drug barons when he goes to fly the plane, e.g. by locking the cockpit door from the inside to prevent Pablo Cortez bursting in on him? That is, should we make Cortez burst in and upset things if the player character doesn't lock the cockpit door before attempting to fly the plane? How might we clue the player that he needs to do this? Could we extend the game a few turns beyond takeoff so that the player character actually has to turn the plane onto a certain course and radio ahead in order to win?</p>

<p>There's no compulsion for you or any other reader of this tutorial to pursue any of these questions. By now, you might well prefer to get on with your own game. But if you did want to play around with the Airport game a bit more to practise what you've learned and try out some other things, there's certainly plenty of scope.</p>

<h2>What More is There in adv3Lite?</h2>

<p>While we've covered most of the features of adv3Lite you're likely to use, we haven't covered absolutely everything, so for the sake of completeness we should mention the main features we haven't looked at in this tutorial and point out where you can read about them in the <em>adv3Lite Library Manual</em>.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most common IF trope we haven't even mentioned yet is that of <strong>light and darkness</strong>, i.e. creating one or more rooms that are in darkness, to which the player character has to bring a light source in order to find his/her way around. In some circles such light/darkness puzzles are rather frowned on as being tired and hackneyed, but there's nothing wrong with them if they form a natural and integral part of your story, rather than just being thrown in for the sake of a puzzle. To make a room dark in adv3Lite you just define its <span class="code">isLit</span> property to be nil. You may then want to define its <span class="code">darkName</span> and <span class="code">darkDesc</span> properties to give the name and description of the room that will be displayed while it is in darkness. There are also methods and properties you can define to determine what happens when the player character tries to travel around in the dark. For details, read the section on <a href="../manual/room.htm">Rooms and Regions</a> in the <em>adv3Lite Library Manual</em>. If you define one or more dark rooms your game will probably need a light source or two. The simplest way to make a Thing a light source is to define its <span class="code">isLit</span> property to be true. For a light source you can switch on and off you can use the <span class="code">Flashlight</span> class. If you want an object to be visible in the dark without illuminating anything else (the stars in the night sky, for example, or the shadowy outline of a staircase leading up out of a darkened cellar), you can set its <span class="code">visibleInDark</span> property to true. </p>

<p>Another fairly major adv3Lite feature we haven't touched on at all in this tutorial is the <strong>SenseRegion</strong>. Traditionally in IF, and in all the examples we have seen in this tutorial, the only items that are in scope for the player character are those in his or her immediate location. An actor in IF can usually only sense and interact with objects that are in the same room. The <a href="../manual/senseregion.htm">SenseRegion</a> class allows you to define a set of rooms between which sensory information can pass. This means that, depending on how exactly you set things up, an actor (including the player character) located in one room of the SenseRegion may be able to see, hear and/or smell objects in another room in the same SenseRegion.</p>

<p>It's not that uncommon to see requests on IF fora from time to time asking how to implement a <strong>THINK ABOUT</strong> command (i.e. a command that allows the player to type commands like THINK ABOUT MARTIN and get a sensible response). The adv3Lite library has built-in handling for this, which represents <span class="code">Thoughts</span> as TopicEntries rather in the manner of ConsultTopics used with a Consultable. You can read about it in the section on <a href="../manual/thought.htm">Thoughts</a> in the manual.</p>

<p>We introduced (and employed) the concept of <span class="code">TravelConnectors</span> in the course of the tutorial, but made no mention of the <strong>TravelBarriers</strong>, which it is sometimes useful to define in conjunction with them (especially when the same conditions prohibiting travel potentially apply to more than one TravelConnector). For more details, refer to the section on <a href="../manual/travel.htm">Travel Connectors and Barriers</a> in the manual.</p>

<p>One of the trickiest things to handle in IF can be <strong>attaching</strong> one object to another. It's tricky because attachment can have so many consequences. If I attach the widget to the spungler, should the widget move with the spungler if I attempt to move the spungler, or should it prevent me from moving the spungler or what? If I take hold of the widget while it's attached to the spungler and try to take it into another room, do I drag the spungler along with it, or do I automatically detach it from the spungler, or does the spungler snatch the widget from my grasp, or am I prevented from moving to another location while holding the widget that's attached to the spungler, or does the widget unravel so that I'm left holding one of it in my new location while the other end is still attached to the spungler? There are so many different possibilities that it's virtually impossible for an IF library to cover them all, and adv3Lite doesn't even try to. It does, however, try to offer some support for a few simple, common cases, and you can read about this in the <a href="../manual/attachable.htm">Attachables</a> section of the manual.</p>

<p>A common feature of many IF languages is <strong>Fuses</strong> and <strong>Daemons</strong> (or something that provides similar functionality under a different name). A Fuse provides a means of making something happen after so many turns, while a Daemon provides a way of making something happen each turn (or every so many turns). For details see the section on <a href="../manual/event.htm">Events</a> in the manual.</p>

<p>At various points in the tutorial we've made use of a <span class="code">StopEventList</span> or <span class="code">ShuffledEventList</span>, but we haven't covered <strong>EventLists</strong> in any systematic fashion. For the full story see the section on <a href="../manual/eventlist.htm">EventList</a> in the manual.</p>

<p>Most of what we've covered in this tutorial has assumed that the chief sense being used is the sense of sight. But the adv3Lite library does provide some support for <strong>other senses</strong>. You can read about the <span class="code">listenDesc</span>, <span class="code">feelDesc</span>, <span class="code">smellDesc</span> and other sensory properties of Things in the <a href="../manual/thing.htm#sensory">Things</a> section of the manual. There's also a <span class="code">Noise</span> class and an <span class="code">Odor</span> class you can read about in the <a href="../manual/extra.htm#emanation">Extras</a> section.</p>

<p>Finally, adv3Lite provides the facility for you to display custom <strong>menus</strong> in your game (the hint system makes use of this). For details consult the <a href="../manual/menu.htm">Menus</a> section of the manual.</p>

<h2>What More Might You Need to Know?</h2>

<p>This tutorial has tried to cover most of the basics, but there are a couple of areas where it may have left some gaps in your knowledge.</p>

<p>First, we really only have covered the basics of dealing with actions. In particular, we've largely only dealt with one kind of action, the kind that simply takes a direct object (e.g. PULL STICK). But in writing IF it is often necessary to deal with many other kinds of action: those that act on both a direct and an indirect object (e.g. TURN BOLT WITH WRENCH) or those that act on no object at all (e.g. THINK), or those that act on Topics or Literals. Before you can get very far with writing your own game you will need to understand the differences between these various kinds of action and how to deal with them. The Action <a href="../manual/actionoverview.htm">Overview</a> section of the manual is vital reading in this regard, but you'll really need to study the entire Chapter on <a href="../manual/action.htm">Actions</a> sooner rather than later.</p>

<p>Second, while this tutorial has made some attempt to introduce features of the TADS 3 <em>language</em>, it has only introduced some of the most common ones, and even then not in an entirely systematic fashion. More detailed and systematic information on the TADS 3 language is contained in the <em>TADS 3 System Manual</em>, and it really is information you need to know to be effective as a TADS 3 programmer. Unfortunately (or fortunately, perhaps, depending on your point of view) not all the information in the <em>TADS 3 System Manual</em> is equally relevant to the day-to-day tasks of the TADS 3 game author, so you certainly don't need to read all of it to start out with.</p>

<p>The following sections of the <a href="../sysman/toc.htm">TADS 3 System Manual</a> are probably the ones you'll need to become familiar with sooner rather than later:</p>

<h3>Part III: The Language</h3>
<a href="../sysman/progstru.htm"><p>Source Code Structure</a><br>
<a href="../sysman/types.htm">Fundamental Datatypes</a><br>
<a href="../sysman/strlit.htm">String Literals</a><br>
<a href="../sysman/objdef.htm">Object Definitions</a><br>
<a href="../sysman/expr.htm">Expressions and Operators<br>
<a href="../sysman/proccode.htm">Procedural Code</a></p>

<h3>Part IV: The Intrinsics</h3>
<p><a href="../sysman/tadsgen.htm">tads-gen Function Set</a><br>
 <a href="../sysman/objic.htm">Object</a><br>
 <a href="../sysman/list.htm">List</a><br>
 <a href="../sysman/string.htm">String</a><br>
 <a href="../sysman/tadsobj.htm">TadsObject</a><br>
 <a href="../sysman/vector.htm">Vector</a></p>
 
<h3>Part V: The System Library </h3> 
<p><a href="../sysman/init.htm">Program Initialization</a></p>
<br>

<p>By the way, when I say "need to become familiar with" I certainly <em>don't</em> mean "learn off by heart" but rather read through a couple of times so you become generally familiar with the contents, learn the bits you commonly need to use every day, and know where to look up the rest.</p>

<p>Once you've got going you may also find it worthwhile to read the following sections:</p>
 
<h3>Part III: The Language</h3> 
<p><a href="../sysman/preproc.htm">The Preprocessor</a><br>
<a href="../sysman/enum.htm">Enumerators</a><br>
<a href="../sysman/inherit.htm">The Object Inheritance Model</a><br>
<a href="../sysman/inlineobj.htm">Inline Objects</a><br>
<a href="../sysman/multmeth.htm">Multi-Methods</a><br>
<a href="../sysman/dynobj.htm">Dynamic Object Creation</a><br>
<a href="../sysman/optparams.htm">Optional Parameters</a><br>
<a href="../sysman/namedargs.htm">Named Arguments</a><br>
<a href="../sysman/except.htm">Exceptions and Error Handling</a><br>
<a href="../sysman/reflect.htm">Reflection</a></p>
 
<h3>Part IV: The Intrinsics</h3>
<p><a href="../sysman/toc.htm">t3vm Function Set</a><br>
<a href="../sysman/regex.htm">Regular Expressions</a><br>
<a href="../sysman/tadsio.htm">tads-io Function Set</a><br>
<a href="../sysman/scripts.htm">Input Scripts</a><br>
<a href="../sysman/collect.htm">Collection</a><br>
<a href="../sysman/lookup.htm">LookupTable</a><br>
<a href="../sysman/rexpat.htm">RexPattern</a><br>
<a href="../sysman/strbuf.htm">StringBuffer</a></p>

<p>In addition, if you want to develop games for the Web UI you'll obviously want to read <a href="../sysman/web.htm">Part VII: Playing on the Web</a>.</p>

<p>While none of the material in this second list is vital to writing a game in TADS 3/adv3Lite when you're starting out, it does discuss features of the system which will help you to make the best use of it, so it's well worth getting to know some of it and at least being aware of the existence of the rest so you can come back to it again when you hit a situation it may be helpful for.</p>

<p>The other sections of the <em>TADS 3 System Manual</em> can probably be left until you specifically need them or you're overwhelmed by curiosity to know what's there (it'll be worth succumbing to such curiosity at some stage, since even a relatively obscure feature may turn out to be just the one you want for your particular game).</p>
