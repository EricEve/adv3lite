<h1>How to Create Verbs</h1>

<H2>Adapted for adv3Lite by Eric Eve</h2>
<p>Note: the material in this article covers much the same ground as the
section on <a href='../manual/define.htm'>Defining New Actions</a> in the <i>Adv3Lite Library Manual</i>, but 
it seems worth adapting and keeping Mike Roberts's article on this topic 
as a complementary take on the same material, not least since it often offers
more detailed explanations than the <i>Adv3Lite Library Manual</i>.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Every game based on the TADS 3 standard library automatically gets
the benefit of the huge complement of verbs that the library defines -
about 150 of them.  Even though so many verbs are pre-defined, though,
it's a good bet that many games - maybe even most - will have at least
one or two situations where a custom verb is needed.  Fortunately, it's
relatively easy to add new, custom verbs to a TADS 3 game.

<p>The method for adding a verb depends on what kind of verb you're
adding.  We'll go over the main types one at a time.  Note that the
techniques we describe here are exactly the same techniques that the
library uses to define its own verbs - this means your new verbs are true
first-class citizens, fully on par with the pre-defined library verbs.

<p>The examples in this article are written for the English version of
the library.  The syntax used to define verbs varies by language, so
these examples probably won't work with other language versions.  To
use the English library's special features in your game, you need to
include the library's English language header in each of your source
files, along with the main library header.  Just put these lines at
the start of each of your ".t" source files:

<p><pre>
   #include "advlite.h"
</pre>

<h2>Verbs with no objects</h2>

<p>A verb that doesn't take any objects is called an "intransitive"
verb.  This is a verb like LOOK AROUND or SLEEP that expresses an
action without mentioning any objects.

<p>To create an intransitive verb, you have to write two bits of
code, like this:

<p>
<pre>
   DefineIAction(Sleep)
     execAction(c) { DMsg(not sleepy, '{I\'m} not sleepy right now. '); }
   ;

   VerbRule(Sleep)
     'sleep' | 'doze' 'off' | 'nod' 'off'
     : VerbProduction
     action = Sleep
     verbPhrase = 'sleep/sleeping'
   ;
</pre>

<p>The first part, DefineIAction, defines the "Action" object for your
new verb.  This Action object represents the verb during command
execution.  DefineIAction (which stands for "Define Intransitive
Action") is a macro defined in the adv3Lite library that takes care of
some of the tedious busy-work of creating your Action object; under
the covers, this macro just starts an object definition for you and
fills in a few properties.  The name in parentheses is the name
of the object.

<p>The execAction(<i>c</i>) definition is just a normal method definition
that's part of your Action class.  For an intransitive action, this
method is what actually carries out the action, so you simply write
code here for whatever you want the verb to accomplish. The <i>c</i>
parameter is the Command object created for the current command, but
we don't need to worry about that now.

<p>The second part, VerbRule, defines the grammar for your verb.  This
tells the parser the various ways that the player could type this verb
in command input.  The name in parentheses is the "tag," which is
simply a name for the rule, for reference purposes.  In this case, the
tag is "Sleep", which happens to be the same as the root name of the
Action class - but this is completely arbitrary.  We could have made
it "VerbRule(gloxnfab)", and everything would have worked equally
well.  The only important thing about the tag is that it's unique
among all of the VerbRule definitions in the entire game; by
convention, the library usually uses the Action root name as the tag
just because it's an easy way of ensuring uniqueness.  Note, however,
that you sometimes will want to define multiple VerbRule's for the
same Action class, and when you do that, you'll obviously have to come
up with some other unique tag for each rule after the first.  You
could use names like "VerbRule(Sleep2)", for example.

<p>To define the syntax of your verb, you simply list all of the
different phrasings, separating each phrasing from the next with the "|"
character.  Each quoted string is matched exactly to a token - which
means that each word has to go in a separate string, since the
tokenizer breaks up a command into words before the parser starts
matching syntax rules.

<p>Note that, by default, the "|" symbol separates entire phrasings,
so the definition above creates three phrasing: "sleep", "doze off",
and "nod off".  You can also group parts of the phrasing with
parentheses, and then use the "|" symbol to separate individual
sub-phrases; for example, we could also write the grammar above like
this:

<p>
<pre>
   'sleep' | ('doze' | 'nod') 'off'
</pre>

<p>This is the same as the original definition, because it says that
one phrasing is "sleep", and another is <i>either</i> "doze"
<i>or</i> "nod" followed by "off".  It's sometimes more compact to
write rules that group sub-phrases like this, because in English
there are many verbs where there are different phrasings that involve
variations in only one or two words in a longer phrase.

<p>After the grammar rules, you have to specify that your grammar rule
belongs to the VerbProduction class and then define which the Action object
is associated with this VerbRule; in this case, the Action objectis Sleep.
Just as DefineIAction is a macro that defines an Action object,
VerbRule is a macro that defines a subclass of VerbProduction.

<p>Everything else in the VerbRule is an ordinary property or method
definition.  Every VerbRule should define a verbPhrase property, giving
a string that's used as a message template for the verb.  Don't confuse
this with the grammar rule - the verbPhrase isn't used to parse anything,
but is simply used to generate messages.  You should always use the
format shown above for an intransitive verb.  Note that you only
specify one phrasing in the verbPhrase, no matter how many phrasings
you define in the grammar.

<h2>Verbs with one object</h2>

<p>Many verbs require an object to operate upon: TAKE THE KEY, READ
THE BOOK.  These are called "transitive" verbs, and the object that a
transitive verb operates upon is called the verb's "direct object."

<p>Here's an example of defining a transitive verb:

<p>
<pre>
   DefineTAction(Repair);

   VerbRule(Repair)
     ('repair' | 'fix') singleDobj
     : VerbProduction
     action = Repair
     verbPhrase = 'repair/repairing (what)'
     missingQ = 'what do you want to repair'
     dobjReply = singleNoun
   ;

   modify Thing
     dobjFor(Repair)
     {
       preCond = [touchObj]
     
       verify() 
       {
         if(!isRepairable)
            illogical(cannotRepairMsg);
       }
     }
     
     isRepairable = nil
     cannotRepairMsg = '{I} {do}n\'t know how to repair {that dobj}. '
   ;
</pre>

<p>The first part defines the Action class for the new verb.
DefineTAction stands for "Define Transitive Action"; it's a macro
provided by the library to handle the tedious parts of defining the
new verb.  Note that unlike our intransitive verb example earlier,
we do <b>not</b> define an execAction(c) for a transitive verb; this
is because a transitive verb is executed by the direct object, not
by the action class itself.

<p>The second part defines the grammar rule for the new verb.  This is
very similar to defining a VerbRule for an intransitive action, but
note some important differences.  First, the grammar rule has to
include a "slot" for the direct object.  In this case, we did that
using the special keyword singleDobj: this indicates that the slot can
only take a single object, not a list of objects (so we won't be
allowed to type REPAIR ALL or REPAIR TOY, SLIDE PROJECTOR, AND
TOASTER; if we do, the parser will politely let us know that we have
to repair one thing at a time).  We could instead have used multiDobj,
which indicates that the slot <i>can</i> take multiple objects at
once.  Second, the verbPhrase also has to include a placeholder for
the direct object, which we do by writing "(what)".  We could instead
write "(whom)", if the direct object for the verb is typically a
person rather than an inanimate object; for example, a "talk to"
action would probably write its verbPhrase as 'talk/talking (to
whom)'. Third, the missingQ provides the text of the question the 
parser will ask if the player simply types REPAIR, without specifying
what to repair (the parser will captilize the start of the sentence
and finish it with a question mark, so we don't need to so on
the missingQ property. Finally dobjReply = singleNoun tells the 
parser to expect the player to respond with the name of a single
noun if it asks the player what they want to repair. If we'd 
used multiDobj instead of singleDobj in our grammar definition
we could specify dobjReply = nounList, but we don't too since the
library will assume this is we don't specify otherwise.


<p> <blockquote>

<b>verbPhrase and prepositions:</b> Verb phrasings that involve
prepositions, such as "talk/talking (to whom)", can be written two
ways: with the preposition inside or outside the parentheses.  And the
placement <b>does</b> matter.  Write the preposition <b>inside</b> the
parentheses if it belongs with the noun phrase of the direct or
indirect object.  Write the preposition <b>outside</b> the parentheses
if it's not a true preposition a "particle" - that is, a word that
happens to be a preposition but when used with the given verb actually
changes the meaning of the verb.  For example, the "up" in "pick up"
is a particle, because it changes the whole meaning of the verb from
"choose" to "take."

<p>Fortunately, there's an easy rule of thumb for deciding which is
which.  Try sounding out the sentence using a pronoun for the direct
object, and see if it sounds more natural for the preposition to go
before or after the pronoun.  If the preposition goes before, then
it's really a preposition, so it goes with the direct object phrase,
hence it goes <b>inside</b> the parentheses: "talk to him" sounds
right, and "talk him to" obviously sounds wrong.  Thus, the verbPhrase
for this command would be 'talk (to whom)'.  If, however, the
preposition sounds better at the end of the sentence, it's a particle:
"pick it up" sounds much better than "pick up it."  If it's a
particle, it goes <b>outside</b> the parentheses, so the verbPhrase
becomes 'pick up (what)'.

<p>To summarize: if the preposition goes after the pronoun, it's a
particle, so put the preposition with the verb: 'pick up (what)'.  If
the preposition goes before the pronoun, it goes with the direct
object: 'talk (to whom)'.

</blockquote>

<p>The third part is where we carry out the verb's action, or at
least carry out its default action.  A transitive verb is executed by
calling methods on the verb's direct object.  Now, in many cases, a
new verb will only apply to a few objects, so it might be tempting to
define handlers only for those objects.  However, a player might not
know the limits you had in mind, or might just want to be difficult,
so the player could conceivably try applying your verb to any object
in the game.  The best way to cope with this is to write a default
handler in the Thing class, since virtually every game object is
typically based on Thing, either directly or indirectly.  Because a
new verb usually won't have any effect on just any random object, the
default Thing handler can be a simple "illogical" call in the
verify() method, as shown above, or it may be more elaborate,
(e.g., to rule out an actor trying to repair themselves).  If you want the default handling to
actually do something, just write the appropriate dobjFor() code as
you would for any pre-defined library verb.</p>

<p>It's a good idea to define custom properties such as
<code>isRepairable</code> and <code>cannotRepairMsg</code> as above,
since this allows easier customization than having to override
verify() methods just to vary the refusal response or allowed
repairing (which may be particularly pertinent if we have a
more complex verify() method containing further global sanity checks
which we want to keep on all objects). Then, for example, if you
want the response to REPAIR AUNT MABEL to be 'If you only you could!'
you only need to override the <code>cannotRepairMsg</code> on your
mabel object without having to rewrite the entire verify() method.

<h2>Verbs with two objects</h2>

<p>Some verbs take not one but two objects: PUT BOOK ON SHELF,
UNLOCK DOOR WITH KEY.  

<p>Note that we're not talking about commands that list multiple
direct objects, such as TAKE BOOK AND KEY: those are still one-object
verbs in the sense we're talking about here, because there's only one
role that an object can play with the verb.  If a list of objects is
specified for the single role of a one-object verb, it's just saying
that the verb should be applied in turn to each object in the list,
with each object serving the same role.  Instead, what we're talking
about here is verbs that have two objects in <i>different roles</i>.

<p>In UNLOCK DOOR WITH KEY, the key is the "instrument" or "agent" of
the action, but the door is what's being unlocked; we're not
unlocking the key, obviously.  The door is called the "direct
object," because it's the object that's being directly affected by
the action.  The key is called the "indirect object," because it's
being used in the course of performing the action but isn't the main
focus of the action.

<p>Creating a two-object action is a lot like creating a one-object verb:

<p>
<pre>
   DefineTIAction(ScrapeWith);

   VerbRule(ScrapeWith)
     'scrape' multiDobj 'with' singleIobj
     : VerbProduction 
     action = ScrapeWith
     verbPhrase = 'scrape/scraping (what) (with what)'
     missingQ = 'what do you want to scrape; what do you want to scrape it with'
     iobjReply = withSingleNoun
   ;

   modify Thing
     dobjFor(ScrapeWith)
     {
       preCond = [objHeld]
       
       verify() 0
       {
          if(!isScrapeable)        
             illogical(cannotScrapeMsg);
             
          if(gIobj == self)
             illogicalSelf(cannotScrapeWithSelfMsg);
       }
     }
     iobjFor(ScrapeWith)
     {     
       preCond = [objHeld]
       
       verify() 
       {
         if(!canScrapeWithMe)
             illogical(cannotScrapeWithMsg);
       }
     }
   
   
     cannotScrapeMsg = 'That subj dobj} {isn\'t} something {i} {can} scrape}. '
     cannotScrapeWithSelfMsg = '{I} {can} hardly scrape {the dobj} with {itself dobj}. '
     cannotScrapeWithMsg = '{That subj iobj} {doesn\'t look} very useful as a scraping tool. '
     isScrapeable = nil
     canScrapeWithMe = nil
 ; 
</pre>

<p>As with a regular transitive action, we first define the Action
object, this time using DefineTIAction.  DefineTIAction stands for
"Define Transitive with Indirect object Action"; it defines an action
with both a direct and an indirect object.

<p>The VerbRule grammar for a two-object action requires two object
slots, one for the direct object and one for the indirect object.  The
direct object slot is indicated using singleDobj or multiDobj, just as it
is for a regular transitive action.  The indirect object slot is indicated
with the similar singleIobj or multiIobj keywords.

<p>There are a couple of restrictions on these object slots keyword
to be aware of.  First, exactly one direct object and one indirect
object slot must be included in each grammar rule, for fairly obvious
reasons.  Second, less obviously, <b>at most one</b> of the slots can
be a "multi" keyword.  So, you can't use multiDobj and multiIobj in the
same rule.  You can use singleDobj and singleIobj together, and you
can mix and match the "single" and "multi" keywords, but you can't use
"multi" for both.  The reason for this makes sense if you think about
it: if the player could specify multiple objects for both slots, the
meaning would be terribly unclear, because it would be difficult or
impossible to know which direct object was meant to be used with
which indirect object.  We avoid this confusion by allowing only
one or the other slot to accept multiple objects.

<p>Note that the verbPhrase needs two "(what)" (or "(whom)") markers,
since the verb has two object roles.

<blockquote>
<p>In the verbPhrase string, the indirect object preposition will
<b>always</b> go inside the parentheses of the placeholder, but the
direct object preposition can sometimes go inside and sometimes go
outside.  Use the same rule of thumb as for single-object verbs to
figure out which format to use.  We'd say "look at <i>it</i> through
telescope," not "look <i>it</i> at through telescope," so we'd write
our verbPhrase as 'look (at what) (through what)'.  However, we'd say
"look <i>it</i> up in book" rather than "look up it in book," so this
verbPhrase would be 'look up (what) (in what)'.  You can repeat the
test for the indirect object, but as far as I can tell, English
doesn't have any verb phrases where the indirect object part of the
phrase involves a particle.
</blockquote>

<p>In writing our default action handler in Thing, we must write
not only a direct object handler (using dobjFor), but an indirect
object handler (using iobjFor) as well.  As with plain transitive
actions, these default handlers will usually just disallow the
action in one way or another, and, in this case, rule out an object
being used on itself.

<h2>Verbs with a "literal" object</h2>

<p>Sometimes, a verb superficially looks like a transitive verb,
but rather than taking an ordinary direct object, the verb takes
a literal phrase as its object.  For example, in SAY HELLO, the
object of the verb is literally the word "hello." (Note that the
adv3Lite libary already has its own SAY verb, though).

<p>You can define a verb that takes a literal object like this:

<p>
<pre>
   DefineLiteralAction(Say)
     execAction(c)
     {
       "Okay,  &lt;&lt;gLiteral&gt;&gt;. ";
     }
   ;

   VerbRule(Say)
     'say' literalDobj
     : VerbProduction
     action = Say
     verbPhrase = 'say/saying (what)'
     missingQ = 'what do you want to say'
   ;
</pre>

<p>Even though a "literal action" has the superficial grammatical
form of a transitive action, we must define an execAction(c) to
execute the verb, just as we would for an intransitive action.  This
is because a literal action doesn't have a direct object in the usual
sense; there's no game object where we can write a dobjFor()
definition, since the "object" of the verb is just some literal text.
Note also that we can obtain the literal text that the user typed in
by using the gLiteral macro. 
gLiteral returns a string giving the actual text that the user
typed in (the string returned even preserves the original upper/lower
case of the text the user entered).

<p>In the VerbRule, the "slot" for the literal text must be indicated
with the literalDobj keyword.  In command input, the player can
enter literal text with or without quotes: SAY HELLO and SAY "HELLO"
will both match this grammar.  If the user does use quotes, note that
getLiteral will <b>not</b> include
the quotes in its returned value; this means that you don't have to
worry about whether or not the player used quotes, since getLiteral()
will just return the meaningful part of the text in either case.

<h2>Verbs with one object plus a literal</h2>

<p>Some verbs take both an ordinary object and a literal: TYPE XYZ
ON KEYBOARD or WRITE "SEND HELP" ON NAPKIN.  We can define this
kind of verb like so:

<p>
<pre>
   DefineLiteralTAction(WriteOn);

   VerbRule(WriteOn)
    'write' literalDobj ('on' | 'in') singleIobj
    : VerbProduction
    action = WriteOn
    verbPhrase = 'write/writing (what) (on what)'
    missingQ = 'what do you want to write;what do you want to write that on'
    dobjReply = onSingleNoun
;

   modify Thing
    canWriteOnMe = nil
        
    dobjFor(WriteOn)
    {
        preCond = [touchObj]
        verify() 
        { 
            if(!canWriteOnMe)
               illogical(cannotWriteOnMsg); 
        }        
        
    }
   ;

   // later, as part of some room definition...
   + paper: Thing 'piece of paper'
     "It's a piece of paper, with some hand-written notes:
      \b&lt;&lt; noteText &gt;&gt; "

     noteText = 'Get eggs!'
     canWriteOnMe = true

     dobjFor(WriteOn)
     {       
       action()
       {
         "You add your notes to the paper. ";
         noteText += '\n' + gLiteral;
       }
     }
   ;
</pre>

<p>As you might expect, this type of verb combines some of the
features of the regular transitive action with the literal action.
There's one special thing to note, though: the ordinary object (the
object that's not the literal) is <i>always</i> considered the direct
object, for the purposes of the dobjFor() handler.  In this
example, you can see that the ordinary object fills what would be the
indirect object in a TIAction: it's in the second object slot in the
grammar, and it follows a preposition, which is usually a dead
give-away that it's an indirect object.  Regardless of this, we must
treat the ordinary object as a direct object in all of our object
definitions.


<h2>Verbs with a "topic" object</h2>

<p>Some verbs involve a mere <i>reference</i> to an object, rather
than an action applied to the object.  For example, THINK ABOUT
AIRLOCK doesn't actually do anything to the "airlock" object, and it
doesn't require that the object be physically present; the action
simply makes mention of the airlock.  In a sense, the direct object
is not really the object itself but instead some kind of abstract
idea of the object.  We call these abstract ideas "topics."

<p>We can define a verb that operates on a topic like this:

<p>
<pre>
   DefineTopicAction(ThinkAbout)
     execAction(c)
     {
         "Hmm &lt;&lt;gTopicText&gt;&gt;, very interesting";      
     }
   ;

   VerbRule(ThinkAbout)
    ('think' | 'ponder' | 'cogitate') 'about' topicDobj
    : VerbProduction
    action = ThinkAbout
    verbPhrase = 'think/thinking (about what)'
    missingQ = 'what do you want to think about'
    dobjReply = aboutTopicPhrase
;
</pre>

<p>As with literal actions, we must define the handler for a topic
action with an execAction(c) method on the topic action itself.  Note
that we can use the gTopic macro to obtain the
topic.  gTopic returns an object of class ResolvedTopic that
describes the topic that the player typed.  We won't go into detail
on ResolvedTopic here, but we will point out that you can get the
original text the player typed by calling the getTopicText() method
on the ResolvedTopic object or by just using the gTopicText macro.

<p>In defining the VerbRule for a topic action, you must use
the topicDobj keyword to indicate the slot for the topic in the
grammar.

<h2>Verbs with one object plus a topic</h2>

<p>As with literals, we sometimes want to combine a topic and
an ordinary object: CONSULT TEXTBOOK ABOUT NUMERICAL INTEGRATION.
We can define these verbs in much the same way that we define
literal actions:

<p>
<pre>
   DefineTopicTAction(LookUp);

   VerbRule(LookUp)
    (('look' | 'l') ('up' | 'for') | 'find'  | 'search' 'for' | 'read' 'about')
    topicIobj ('in' | 'on') singleDobj
    | ('look' | 'l') topicIobj 'up' ('in' | 'on') singleDobj
    : VerbProduction
    action = LookUo
    verbPhrase = 'look/looking up (what) (in what)'
    missingQ = 'what do you want to look that up in;what do you want to look up'
    dobjReply = singleNoun
    iobjReply = topicPhrase
;

   modify Thing
     dobjFor(LookUp)
     {
       preCond = [objVisible]
     
       verify() 
       { 
         illogical('{The subj dobj} {doesn\'t seem} to work that way. ');
       }  
     }
   ;

   // later, in some room definition
   + dictionary: Thing'dictionary' 
     "Frobster's Third Collegiate Unabridged. "

     dobjFor(LookUp)
     {
       verify() { }
       action()
       {
         local wrd = gTopicText()
         local def = dictionaryTable[wrd];
         if (entry != nil)
           "&lt;b&gt;&lt;&lt;wrd&gt;&gt;&lt;/b&gt;: &lt;&lt;def&gt;&gt; ";
         else
           "You can't seem to find an entry for &lt;q&gt;&lt;&lt;wrd&gt;&gt;&lt;/q&gt;
           in the dictionary. ";
       }
     }

     // filling up the dictionary is left as an exercise to the reader
     dictionaryTable = static new LookupTable(32, 64)
   ;
</pre>

<p>Note that we use topicIobj to indicate the topic slot in the
grammar.  As with the literal transitive action, the ordinary object
<i>always</i> takes the functional role of the direct object, and
we must include the grammatical role of the literal phrase, for
message-generation purposes, as the second argument to the
DefineTopicTAction macro.


<h2>Verbs with three or more objects</h3>

<p>The adv3Lite library doesn't provide any 
verb with more than two object roles.  This doesn't mean that you
can't define such a verb; and adv3Lite does provide
a <a href='../../extensions/docs/tiaaction.htm'>TIA Action</a> extension 
to allow you to create your own verbs with three objects.

<p>The basic principles of the library's parsing and command
execution mechanisms can extend to arbitrarily many object roles in a
single action, so creating a verb with four or more objects would be
a matter of extending the extensions three-object action class (TIAAction) to
resolve and coordinate execution with additional object roles.  But
this would require writing significant amounts of new code; such a
new action class would be at least as complicated as the TIAAction
class, which is not at all trivial.  The details are beyond the scope
of this discussion.

<p>If you're seriously thinking about creating a three-object action,
we'd like to offer this bit of non-technical advice: please
reconsider.  While you might have devised an elegant puzzle that
requires manipulating three things at once in a single command, keep
in mind that your most of your players will be never think of such a
command.  Players don't like having to guess at verbs; guessing at
syntax is even worse.  Players have come to expect a certain range of
syntax in IF, and this works to everyone's advantage: it makes it
easy for players to learn and remember how to write commands, and it
limits the number of variations authors have to program.  In
practice, the two-object verb has proven to be a very comfortable
limit that provides plenty of expressive power but keeps things
simple.

<p>One more suggestion: in most cases that people have found where
three-object verbs seem to be needed, there's almost always a way to
decompose the action into two actions of two objects apiece.  For
example, PUT COIN IN SLOT WITH TWEEZERS could be decomposed into GET
COIN WITH TWEEZERS; PUT COIN IN SLOT.  Many, if not most,
three-object actions involve this pattern of moving one object in
relation to another using a third object, and this pattern frequently
lends itself to decomposition along these same lines.
