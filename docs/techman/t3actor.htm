<h1>Creating Dynamic Characters</h1>
<h2>(Adapted for adv3Lite by Eric Eve)</h2>
<p>Editor's Note: the adaptation required here turned out to be fairly minimal 
apart from the discussion of following and accomanying actors.</p>


<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This article's title makes it sound like one of those how-to books
for novice writers, doesn't it?  Make your characters more exciting,
dynamic, and lifelike!  Make them leap off the page with their
dynamic and vibrant personalities!  Bring them to life with riveting,
dynamic dialog!

<p>Well, this article <i>is</i> about those sorts of things, but not
in quite the same way as those how-to books.  Remember that we're
talking about Interactive Fiction, not the ordinary kind of fiction,
so the term "dynamic" has another meaning in this context.  I'm not
talking about "dynamic" in the sense of exciting, vibrant, and
outgoing; I'm talking about it in the sense of <i>changing over
time</i>.  This article describes some TADS 3 library features that
are designed to make it a lot easier to create dynamic characters.

<p>This article is presented in three parts.  This first part is
about making your characters do things other than just sit around and
wait for the player to ASK ABOUT something.  The second part turns to
the design of conversation systems; it surveys some of the systems
that authors have used in the past, and offers recommendations on
designing your own game's conversations.  The third part gets into
the specifics of programming conversations with the TADS 3 library.

<h2>What's so good about dynamic characters?</h2>

<p>It happens that there's a connection between the "changing over
time" sense of "dynamic" and the "exciting" sense, so in a way I
really am talking about how to make your characters more lifelike and
exciting.  In IF, the best way to create a vibrant, exciting, and,
above all, realistic character is to make the character move around,
do things, and react to the unfolding story, rather than sitting in
one place doing one thing for the whole game.  In our everyday
experience, in our basic psychology, the key feature that
distinguishes living creatures from everything else is that living
things are animated - they move, they have their own will, they're
aware of their surroundings, they react to events.

<p>Now, I'm well aware that this is a very tall order.  If we strip
away all the facades of the library classes and the object-oriented
programming and so on, and we think about it reductively, IF
characters are made of dead, inanimate matter in the form of bits on
a computer disk.  Despite all their complexity, computers just don't
fool anyone into thinking they're living creatures.  Our
animate/inanimate sensors were built into our brains long ago, and
finely honed through millions of years of the urgent necessity to
avoid becoming another living creature's lunch.  We're simply not
fooled - not for long, anyway - even by something as elaborate as a
modern computer.  It's no wonder that most characters in interactive
fiction fail to seem lifelike.  

<p>The situation isn't hopeless, though.  True, we're not going to be
able to create a character simulation good enough to truly fool
anyone; that's the very definition of the legendary Turing Test, and
if we could actually beat the Turing Test, we'd be spending our time
collecting accolades and royalty checks rather than fooling around
with adventure games.  So let's accept this reality and move on.
Fortunately, passing a Turing Test, exciting as it would be, isn't
necessary for our purposes.  Remember what the "F" in "IF" stands
for.  Humans are maddeningly good at telling animate from inanimate,
but they're also pretty good at what's known as "suspending
disbelief": accepting a story on its own terms, buying into it
emotionally, even believing in the story, while all along knowing
perfectly well that it's completely made up.  

<p>People <i>love</i> to suspend their disbelief.  They pay good
money to publishers and film studios to give them an excuse to do it
- and if you've seen a Hollywood movie lately, it's pretty obvious
that it doesn't even have to be a good excuse.  You don't have to
fool people into doing it or coerce them into doing it; you get it for
free just by announcing that you're going to tell them a story.  Once
you've got a reader willingly suspending her disbelief, the game is
yours to lose.  The easiest way to lose the player's cooperation is
to violate your story's own rules, by doing something blatantly
inconsistent with the expectations the story has created.

<p>(Okay, before you complain that I'm being too simplisitic, I'll
happily concede that upsetting expectations is a basic tool for any
good writer, that the only rule in writing is that there are no
rules, etc.  But there are good sorts of surprises and bad sorts.
The good kinds are usually the ones that are surprising within the
context of the story; the bad kinds are usually the ones that blow
away the whole context.  Finding out that the first-person
protagonist is actually the killer - that's a good kind.  Learning
that the whole story was a dream - bad kind.  The difference is that
the first kind doesn't change anything about the story-telling
framework, while the second kind does; the second kind has the author
intruding by telling you that the <i>story-telling</i> was just a
story, which is <i>not</i> something you accepted going in.  In very
rare cases, and in the hands of a very skillful author, the
meta-story surprise can work to great effect - but these tricks are
lame a lot more often than they're great.  And anyway, that's not the
sort of well-thought-out surprise twist kind of device I'm talking
about.  When I talk about blatant inconsistency and violating your
own rules, I'm just talking about things that will look to the player
like programming bugs.)

<h2>How <i>not</i> to create dynamic characters</h2>

<p>Okay, let's get more specific about the sorts of inconsistencies
that plague characters in IF.  Let's look at a character in a hypothetical
game:

<p><pre>
  &gt;look
  <b>Baccarat Table (on the chair)</b>
  Here in the high-stakes room, they don't put any tacky
  markings on the violet felt of the Baccarat tables.  The
  air is just as smoky as where the rabble play, of course,
  so you can't see far down the aisle that extends east and
  west through the card tables.

  On the table are the dealer's cards, your cards, the
  tuxedo man's cards, and a martini.

  The dealer stands behind the table.

  A man in a tuxedo is sitting at the table.

  &gt;x man
  He's dressed suavely in a black tuxedo, and he's smoking
  a long cigarette.

  &gt;ask man about baccarat
  He takes a drag on his cigarette, and blows a puff of smoke
  to one side.  "Baccarat, like life, is all about risk."
</pre>

<p>Now suppose that this is going to be a cautionary tale about the dangers
of mixing drinking, gambling, and smoking.

<p><pre>
  The man in the tuxedo takes a sip of his martini, spilling
  a little on one of his cards.  With his other hand, he
  reaches out to put some chips on the table - but he's also
  holding his cigarrete with that hand, and some ashes fall
  off right on the spot where the martini spilled.  Alcohol
  and paper are a flammable combination, as everyone knows,
  so it bursts into flames!  The man tries to put out the
  fire, but his hands are so full that he spills the martini
  all over himself.  Now his hair's on fire!
</pre>

<p>So far, so good (well, maybe the prose could be spruced
up a bit, but anyway).  Let's run through some of the same
commands from above now that the man's hair is on fire:

<p><pre>
  &gt;look
  <b>Baccarat Table (on the chair)</b>
  Here in the high-stakes room, they don't put any tacky
  markings on the violet felt of the Baccarat tables.  The
  air is just as smoky as where the rabble play, of course,
  so you can't see far down the aisle that extends east and
  west through the card tables.

  On the table are the dealer's cards, your cards, the
  tuxedo man's cards, and a martini.

  The dealer stands behind the table.

  A man in a tuxedo is sitting at the table.

  The man in the tuxedo is running around screaming, "Ow! My
  hair is on fire! Help!"

  &gt;x man
  He's dressed suavely in a black tuxedo, and he's smoking
  a long cigarette.

  The man in the tuxedo's hair is on fire!  He's yelling, "Ow!"

  &gt;ask man about baccarat
  He takes a drag on his cigarette, and blows a puff of smoke
  to one side.  "Baccarat, like life, is all about risk."

  The man in the tuxedo yells, "Ow!"  His hair is on fire!
</pre>

<p>Ever played a game like this?  I have.  I don't mean to
make fun of authors who make these kinds of mistakes, and I'm
certainly not parodying any specific game - I'm not even thinking of
a specific example.  I'm just trying to give you a clear picture of
why it's so darned hard to program convincing characters in IF.

<p>The problem is that characters have a lot of special, custom code
to implement all of their different aspects, and all of that custom
code has to be further customized for each different thing the
character does.  It's a multiplicative problem: just to write a basic
character that does nothing, you have to write ten different bits of
code; to write a character that does two different things (sits at
table, runs around with hair on fire), you have to write those same
ten bits again for the second case, so now you have twenty bits;
three different behaviors, thirty bits.  In the example above, we see
four separate things that we have to customize for the "hair on fire"
situation: the character's room description message; the "examine"
description; the response to ASK ABOUT BACCARAT; and the "daemon"
routine that lets the character do something by itself on each turn.
That's not even the end of it.  To be really thorough, we'd also have
to customize giving the character orders (MAN, GO NORTH), all of the
<i>other</i> ASK ABOUT topics, HELLO, GIVE TO, SHOW TO, and TELL TO.

<h2>How to create dull, lifeless, static characters</h2>

<p>I have a lot of friends who work in the software industry.  One of
the interesting things about software companies is that they're all
relatively young as corporations go; as a result, when it comes to
their business processes, a lot of them essentially make it up as
they go along.  One amusing story I've heard, from sources at more
than one company, is about an ingenious solution to the problem of
schedule slips.  It seems that certain companies have discovered that
the development process tends to get bogged down in the testing
phase; the QA department keeps finding bugs, forcing development to
go back and spend a bunch of time fixing things - frequently, this
time was not budgeted in the release schedule, so each bug discovered
makes the software slip further past its announced release date.
Nobody likes these delays.  These several companies realized that the
true source of this recurring problem is that the QA department keeps
finding bugs.  Dump the QA department, and you stop finding bugs.
Stop finding bugs, and you ship on time!  I'm not making this up.

<p>Unfortunately, IF authors are all too often moved by a similar
impulse when it comes to dealing with the exploding complexity of
making characters do things: it's not the QA department that gets
dumped, it's the interactivity.  It's fully understandable, and I've
fallen victim to this myself, so I'm hardly in a position to impugn
the moral rectitude of anyone else who's done it.  I can think of
three main ways this manifests itself:

<ul> 

  <li>The completely static character.  This is by far the most
common solution to the problem: you simply build a character that
doesn't do anything on its own.  If the man in the tuxedo doesn't do
anything but sit at the table, then you only have to write a single
description, a single response to ASK MAN ABOUT BACCARAT, and so on.

  <li>The bland, unresponsive character.  In this approach, you
either generalize or disable most of the things that you'd otherwise
have to customize for each different behavior.  You make the
description so general that one size fits all.  (Coming up with a
description that works for both "sitting at table" and "hair on fire"
would be a challenge, but the range of behaviors isn't usually so
extreme.)  You don't answer ASK ABOUT questions at all, but use some
sufficiently generic non-response, such as "there's no reply."
Likewise for the other forms of interaction.  

  <li>The "cut scene" character.  In this approach, you create a
character that exists only as text.  This kind of character pops in
between commands, says or does something, and then leaves the scene
before the player has a chance to type a single command.  You don't
even need an "Actor" object for this technique - just text. 

</ul>

<p>I don't want to suggest that these techniques are <i>never</i>
appropriate.  On the contrary: these are all perfectly good ways to
handle characters who are nothing more than scenery, or who exist
only to provide some necessary bit of plot advancement.  You'd
obviously go insane trying to do better than these for a crowd of
supernumeraries in a street scene - and there'd be no point anyway,
as few players would ever notice the extra detail.  But a lot of
games have at least one or two important non-player characters.  If
an NPC is important to the story, it's vital that the NPC rises above
these expedients.

<h2>How to program dynamic characters before TADS 3</h2>

<p>By now, I hope I've persuaded you that building dynamic IF
characters is hard work, <i>and</i> that you should do it anyway.  If
you've ever written a game before, then you're probably feeling like
you're playing the choir to my preacher on the "it's hard" part; and
if you've played many text games, then likewise on the "you should"
part.  Bear with me; we're almost to the interesting "how-to"
material, but there's one more bit of problem-framing I want to do
first.

<p>Looking at the problem description so far, and seeing it reduced
to a list of things that have to be customized for each behavior, you
might be starting to wonder if IF authors aren't just a bunch of big
babies for thinking NPCs are so hard.  After all, we can make a list
of things that have to be done; why not just sit down and write the
code?  Shouldn't it just be a matter of going down the list and
cranking out the if-then-else branches?  Well, yes, that's pretty
much it; but in practice, that's a lot worse than it might sound.

<p>The thing that really makes it so hard, I think, is that the
straightforward approach to handling this - the big pile of
if-then-else branches - turns out to be a really poor way of
organizing code.  We have to write a bunch of routines that all have
a similar form:

<p><pre>
  desc()
  {
    if (hairOnFire)
      // do one thing
    else
      // do another
  }
  actorHereDesc()
  {
    if (hairOnFire)
      // etc
    else
      // etc etc
  }
  dobjFor(AskAbout)
  {
    action()
    {
      if (hairOnFire)
        // etc
      else
        // &amp;c.
    }
  }
</pre>

<p>...and so on for all of the different things that need to be
customized.  One obvious problem with this approach is that it's just
plain tedious; it's a lot of repetitive typing, and it's a lot of
steps to remember every time you add a new behavior or change an
existing one.  Yes, you could use a checklist to make sure you
remember everything, but who really wants to program that way?  If
you can't keep it all in your head, or copy-and-paste from a previous
example, it's too much overhead.  And the busy-work aspect is, I
think, a much bigger obstacle than it might seem at first glance.  My
guess is that a lot of authors have found themselves thinking of a
great new thing for an NPC to do, but then they picture the dozen or
so if-then-else branches they'd have to modify, and the cool new
thing doesn't seem so important any more.  

<p>There's another, bigger problem, though.  If you want to find out
what happens in the "hair on fire" case, you have to look all over
the place.  An important principle of good software design is that
you <i>shouldn't</i> have to look all over the place for related
code; good software keeps related code together.

<h2>How to program dynamic characters in TADS 3</h2>

<p>This, finally, brings us to the matters that I actually set out to
talk about: what the TADS 3 library can do to help.  Past IF
libraries (TADS 2's included) have been remarkably skimpy in the area
of NPC support.  The TADS 3 library tries to break from this
tradition by providing some programming patterns, along with
supporting classes, designed to make it a lot less work to create
well-developed NPCs.

<h3>Actor state objects</h3>

<p>One of the key benefits that's made object-oriented programming so
popular is that it provides a pretty decent framework for keeping
related code together.  As we saw above, the usual approach to
writing dynamic NPCs - a huge network of if-then-else tests - breaks
up related code and scatters it all over the place.  TADS 3 is
supposedly an object-oriented language, but we still have this mess;
so has OOP failed us?  Well, no: we just have to rethink the problem
into a more object-oriented form.

<p>The problem would seem to be that we have a bunch of different
pieces of code that are related, but are all stuck in the "if
(hairOnFire)..." branches of "if" statements, which are scattered
across multiple methods.  OOP's answer to everything is to make an
object; so it seems that what we'd like to do is create an "if
(hairOnFire)" object, and refactor all of those "if" fragments as
methods in our new object.  Something like this:

<p><pre>
  ifHairOnFireObj: object
    desc() { ... }
    actorHereDesc() { ... }
    askAbout() { ... }
    // and so on
  ;
</pre>

<p>Obviously, this doesn't help us much if all we're doing is moving
the fragments from the "if" branches into the new object, and replacing
the branches with calls to the object, like so:

<p><pre>
  // in the original object
  desc()
  {
    if (hairOnFire)
      ifHairOnFireObj.desc();
    else
      // etc
  }
</pre>

<p>This isn't much better than we had before.  The code for
the "hair on fire" cases is at least grouped a little better, but we
still have all of the tedious if-then-else statements to type in, and
we still have to remember to add a new if-then-else branch every time
we add a new behavior.

<p>Once again, object-oriented programming can come to the rescue.
We've already used one key aspect of OOP - encapsulation, the
grouping of related code into an object.  Now we can apply another
key OOP concept - polymorphism, the ability to dispatch calls
dynamically to different objects at run-time.  The trick is to decide
that we're going to store a reference to the "ifHairOnFireObj" object
in the Actor object, by putting it in a property of the Actor.  Not
only that, but we're going to be able to store other objects there as
well.  The idea is that we're going to store the <i>correct</i> one
of these objects there, depending on the actor's current behavior.
So, when we have "hair on fire," we'll store "ifHairOnFireObj"; when
we're "sitting at table," we'll store "ifSittingAtTableObj".  And so
on for other states.  Now, our Actor code is reduced to this:

<p><pre>
  curState = ifHairOnFireObj
  desc() { curState.desc(); }
  actorHereDesc() { curState.actorHereDesc(); }
  dobjFor(AskAbout) { action() { curState.askAbout(); } }
</pre>

<p>See how this works?  The actor code becomes completely freed of
special cases relating to the current behavior - it doesn't have to
know anything about the current behavior except that there <i>is</i>
a current behavior.  For all of the "customization points" that vary
according to the actor's behavior, the Actor code doesn't do anything
except call the current "state object," which encapsulates all of the
custom code relating to the behavior.  This always works the same
way, no matter how many different behaviors the actor has.  To add a
new behavior, you just define a new object along the lines of the
"ifHairOnFireObj" object - we don't have to touch the Actor itself.
To activate the behavior, call the actor's "setState(state)" method,
passing the new state object as the parameter.

<p>Following the example set by the adv3 library, 
the adv3Lite library implements a version of this set-up.  The nice thing
is that all of the basic wiring is pre-defined in the Actor object -
you won't have to write all of those calls to curState.thisAndThat()
yourself.

<h3>The ActorState class</h4>

<p>The class that defines an actor's current behavior is called
ActorState.  The ActorState class itself is 
used directly, and provides a suitable set of defaults that will
work for most actors without further customization.  Of course,
the whole point is to make further customization easier, but the
defaults let you customize only the parts you want to customize.

<p>An ActorState object is associated with an actor via the
ActorState's location property.  ActorState objects aren't simulation
objects (for example, they'll never be listed as part of a room
description, and players can't refer to them in commands), so this
use of the location property doesn't imply containment in the usual
sense.  The reason we use location is that it makes it extremely
convenient to define an actor's state objects - simply use the "+"
notation to put the state objects "inside" the actor:

<p><pre>
  bob: Person
    // ... bob's properties
  ;

  + bobDefault: ActorState
    isInitState = true
    specialDesc = "Bob is here. "
  ;

  + bobSweeping: ActorState
    specialDesc = "Bob is sweeping the porch. "
  ;
</pre>

<p>Here's a summary of most of the important customization points
in the ActorState class, and what they do.

<ul>

<li>stateDesc - this is a message that's added to the actor's basic
description (the "desc" property in the Actor object).  Most
actors will have a permanent description that never changes - a basic
description of their physical appearance - along with some extra
information that describes what they're doing right now.  The
stateDesc lets you add this extra state-dependent part.

<li>specialDesc - displays the actor's in-room description.  This
is the description displayed in the room description (for example,
when entering the room, or in response to a LOOK command).  By default,
we'll invoke the actor's actorSpecialDesc method.


<li>beforeAction(), afterAction() - these give the state object a
chance to react to an action.  The Actor's beforeAction() and
afterAction() methods (respectively) call these on the current state
object, so these simply let you put reaction code with the state
rather than with the actor.

<li>beforeTravel(traveler, connector), afterTravel(traveler, connector) -
like beforeAction() and afterAction(), the Actor forwards these calls
to the ActorState, to give the state object a chance to respond.

<li>activateState(actor, oldState) - this is called when the new state
is about to become active.

<li>deactivateState(actor, newState) - this is called when the state
is active, and another state is about to be activated for the actor.

</ul>

<p>Plus some others you can read about in the chapter on 
 <a href='../manual/actorstate.htm'>Actor States </a> in 
 the <i>Adv3Lite Library Manual</i>


<h3>Hermit states</h4>

<p>An ActorState can be made a Hermit state by defining its noReponse property.
This is useful in a situation that comes up frequently: an actor becomes
temporarily unresponsive, because the actor is busy doing something else.

<p>The hermit state is extremely easy to use.  Just customize the
normal description messages, and add a message to respond to any
sort of interaction (ASK, TELL, GIVE, SHOW, HELLO, etc).

<p><pre>
  + bobStackingCans: ActorState
    stateDesc = "He's stacking cans into a pyramid. "
    specialDesc = "Bob is here, carefully building a pyramid of cans. "
    noResponse = "He seems to be deep in concentration; you
      probably shouldn't disturb him right now. "
  ;
</pre>

<h3>The Actor.curState property</h4>

<p>An actor's current state object is given by the Actor object's
curState property.  This must always be set to a non-nil ActorState
object.  To change an actor's state, simply call the actor's
setCurState(state) method, passing the new state object as the
parameter.

<h3>Setting an actor's initial state</h4>

<p>If you define the property isInitState = true in an ActorState
object, then the library will automatically set the corresponding
actor's curState property to point to that ActorState during
pre-initialization.  This means you don't have to worry about setting
the actor's curState property explicitly; just set isInitState to
true in the state object, and the library will take care of
initializing the actor.

<h3>Stateless Actors</h4>

<p>If all of this sounds like it's way too complex for your simpler
NPCs, don't worry.  ActorState objects are completely optional.

<p>Furthermore, you can always customize an Actor directly in the
Actor.  Reading the description of ActorState, you might have been
worried that, since so much functionality is farmed out to the
ActorState object, you'd be required to create an ActorState object
in order to customize trivial things like the description.  Not so.
The general strategy is that the base ActorState class reflects most
calls back to the corresponding Actor for processing, by default.

<h3>Agendas</h3>

<p>One way that you can make an actor do things on its own is by
programming background activities in the takeTurn() 
on the Actor itself.
For the bulk of NPCs, the only thing you want the actor to do on its
own is display some random background activity messages; for such
simple actors, you can mix in an ActorState with an EventList 
class and define the random background activity messages on its 
eventList property.  In some cases,
though, we want an actor to show some more complex type of initiative,
and procedural scripting can quickly become unwieldy for this.  The
library has a mechanism called "agendas" that can help.

<p>Agendas are for situations where you want an actor to pursue a goal
on its own.

<p>The way agendas work is fairly simple.  Each goal is represented by
an AgendaItem object.  The AgendaItem encapsulates two key bits of
information: first, whether it's ready to execute or not, indicated by
the method isReady(); and second, how to carry out the agenda item, in
the form of a method called invokeItem().  Each actor keeps a vector
of AgendaItem objects, called the actor's "agenda list."  On each
turn, the actor checks its agenda list; if it can find an item that's
ready to execute, it executes that item.  Only one agenda item is
executed on an actor's turn, which aids realism by ensuring that the
actor only tries to do one thing at a time.

<p>You must always nest AgendaItem objects inside their Actor object
using the "+" notation.  This associates the AgendaItem objects with
their actor, but it doesn't add them to the actor's agenda list.  You
must explicitly add agenda items by calling the actor's addToAgenda()
method.  Agenda items must be added explicitly to the actor's agenda
list because an actor's motivation typically changes over time.

<p>Separately from the readiness condition, each item has a "done"
condition that indicates if the item has been accomplished.  This is
the isDone() method.  Once an item is marked as done (that is, once
its isDone() method returns true), the actor will automatically remove
the item from the agenda list.  If you're creating an agenda item that
only has to be executed once, then you can simply set isDone to true
in the item's invokeItem() method; this will ensure that the item is
removed from the agenda list as soon as it's been executed.
Alternatively, you might want the actor to repeatedly try the item
until the item's goal has been accomplished; for these cases, you can
override the item's isDone so that it returns the result of checking
your success condition.  Note that isDone takes precedence over
isReady: if both isDone and isReady return true, the item will
<b>not</b> be executed, because the actor will remove the item from
the agenda list before looking for "ready" items in the list.

<p>One good situation for an agenda is where an NPC wants to get the
player character to talk about something.  For example, an NPC might
want to get a YES or NO answer to some question, but doesn't want to
trap the conversation at that question.  The ConvAgendaItem is ideal
for this sort of situation.  A ConvAgendaItem is a subclass of
AgendaItem that provides a special isReady method that makes the
agenda item ready only when the actor hasn't already engaged in
conversation on the same turn.  This ensures that the NPC will wait
for an opening in the conversation before posing its question.

  bob: Person
    // ... definitions for bob ...
  ;

  + lighthouseAgenda: ConvAgendaItem
    isReady = (inherited() &amp;&amp; me.location == bob.location)
    invokeItem()
    {
      "Bob clears his throat. &lt;q&gt;Did you say you've been to the
      lighthouse today?&lt;/q&gt; he asks, his voice a little shaky. ";

      bob.setConvNode('lighthouse?');
      me.noteConversation(bob);
    }
  ;
</pre>

<p>(We'll see more on "conversation nodes" and other aspects of the
library's conversation system features in <a href='t3conv.htm'>part
three</a> of this article.)

<p>Note that the agenda item doesn't come into play automatically.
You have to explicitly add it to the actor's active agenda list by
calling bob.addToAgenda(lighthouseAgenda).  You'd do this whenever
the agenda item first enters the NPC's motivation, so in this example,
we'd add the agenda item when Bob first hears about the lighthouse
from the player character, perhaps via a TELL ABOUT command.


<h2>Accompanying Travel</h2>

<p>A situation that occurs frequently is something I call
"accompanying travel."  This is where you have one or more actors
traveling along with the player character, but where it's still up to
the player to actually initiate the travel.  For example, a lot of
games have a "sidekick" character who spends most of the game
following the player character everywhere.  This is how sidekicks
are usually implemented:

<p><pre>
  &gt;north
  <b>Hallway</b>
  The dark wood paneling makes this hallway seem even
  narrower than it really is.  The hall extends east
  and west; a door leads south.

  Brent enters from the south.
</pre>

<p>In other words, the sidekick literally follows the player around.
For sidekicks, this is a little clunky but not terrible.  For other
situations, it can be far less palatable.

<p><pre>
  "I told you to keep walking north, human scum" the lead 
  Blurg guard says, poking you again with his hyperlaser.

  &gt;north
  <b>Cell Block</b>
  This is a narrow north-south corridor, lined on
  either side by closed cell doors.

  The guard enters from the south.
</pre>

<p>For any situation where the accompanying character is supposed to
be escorting or leading the player character, having the other
character follow is unsatisfatory.  Even for sidekicks and other
situations where characters are traveling together in a group, it
would be much nicer to have the travel actually described as group
travel, rather than looking as though the others are just happening
to straggle in after the player character.

<p>For the situation where we want the NPC to lead or guide the 
the Player Character, we can use a 
<a href='../manual/agenda.htm#followagenda'>FollowAgendaItem</a>.

<p>If we want the NPC to follow the Actor we can call startFollowing() 
on the Actor object. To stop the Actor following the player character 
we call stopFollowing(). To describe the Actor following the player 
character from one location to another we can define sayFollowing(oldLoc) 
on the Actor's current ActorState or actorSayFollowing(oldLoc) on the Actor,
where <i>oldLoc</i> is the location the Actor has just carried the 
player character from. The location the Actor has just followed the player 
character to can be obtained from gLocation or (if different) gOutermostRoom.</p
