<h1>Some Common Input/Output Issues</h1>
<p><i>by Eric Eve</i>
<h2>(Adapted for Adv3Lite by Eric Eve)</h2>
<p>There is some overlap between this article and the Library Manual section on <a href='../manual/output.htm'>Some Output and Input Issues</a>, but also some additional material as well as a different presentation of the material that does overlap.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>For the most part, input and output in TADS 3 is pretty straightforward. The player
types commands at the command prompt and presses the RETURN or ENTER key, and your
game responds. You output text to the screen using a string in double-quotes such
as <span class="code">"this will be shown on screen"</span> or else by using the 
<span class="code">say()</span> function, and the library contributes to the output
with its own standard messages and responses. For many games this is enough, and
there's no need to complicate matters any further.

<p>Some games, however, may occasionally need to do more, such as pausing the output 
for dramatic effect, clearing the screen, waiting for a keypress, or asking the
player to input something other than a command at the regular command prompt.
TADS 3 provides a set of i/o functions to handle this, which the <i>System Manual</i> 
documents in the section on the <a href = "../sysman/tadsio.htm">
tads-io Function Set</a>. If you've tried to use some of these functions, however,
you may have found that they don't work in quite the way you expected. In fact, they
may not be the best tools to get the job done (and if you want to compile your game for the <a href = "../sysman/webui.htm">Web UI</a> they won't work at all). This article will briefly explore
some of the alternatives.

<h2>The inputManager</h2>

<p>The tads-io function set includes the functions <span class="code">morePrompt()</span>,
which displays a MORE prompt and waits for the player to press a key; 
<span class="code">inputKey()</span>, which waits for the player to press a key and returns the
key pressed, and <span class="code">inputLine()</span>, which reads a whole line of text from
the player (up to the point the player presses the ENTER or RETURN key) and then returns the string entered. 

<p>Since adv3Lite does not use a transcript in the way that adv3 does, using these functions is not so problematic. In adv3 they 
don't entirely work as you want them to. For example, if in adv3 you  try placing <span class="code">morePrompt()</span> in a the middle of some text to create a dramatic pause, 
what actually happens is that all your text is displayed, and only then the does the more 
prompt appear, at the end, and not in the middle where you actually wanted it. E.g. you might
write code like: 

<p><div class="code"><pre>
"The evil baby-eating villain points his splat-gun at you, pulls the trigger and...";  
morePrompt();   
"... suffers a sudden fatal heart attack! ";  
</p></div> 
  

<p>But you then find the more prompt is actually displayed after the second line of text,
defeating your dramatic pause. 

<p>This problem does not occur in adv3Lite, but it is still preferable to use <b>inputManager</b> methods rather than the tadsio functions in case you subsequently want to convert your game to work with the <a href='../sysman/web.htm'>WebUI</a> interface.

<p>Our previous example then becomes: </p>

<p><div class="code"><pre>
"The evil baby-eating villain points his splat-gun at you, pulls the trigger and...";   
inputManager.pauseForMore(true);   
"... suffers a sudden fatal heart attack! ";  
</p></div> 


<p>So rather than use the three tads-io functions mentioned above, it's
generally better to use the corresponding inputManager methods: 

<ul>
<li>Instead of <span class="code">morePrompt()</span> use 
<span class="code">inputManager.pauseForMore()</span>;</li>
  
<li>Instead of <span class="code">inputKey(<i>promptFunc?</i>)</span>
use <span class="code">inputManager.getKey()</span>;</li>
  
<li>Instead of <span class="code">inputLine()</span> use
<span class="code">inputManager.getInputLine(<i>promptFunc?</i>)</span>;  
</ul> 
 
<p>The <i>promptFunc</i> parameter can be supplied either as an anonymous function that displays a prompt or simply as a single-quoted string. For <code>getInputLine()</code> and <code>getKey()</code> (or their macro equivalents - see below) this parameter can be omitted altogether; you can simply display a prompt string before calling the method.


<p>For the most common cases you can use the following macros:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>more</b> expands to inputManager.pauseForMore()</li>
<li><b>input(x)</b> expands to inputManager.getInputLine(x)</li>
<li><b>waitKey(x)</b> expands to inputManager.getKey(x)</li>
</ul>

<p>You shouldn't use the built-in function <code>clearScreen()</code>, just as you shouldn't use any other built-in I/O functions. Use <code>cls()</code> instead - this will work correctly in both Adv3Lite and Adv3LiteWeb.</p>


<h2><a name=cls>The About Box and Clearing the Screen</a></h2>

<p>There may be points in the game when you want to clear the screen: for example, at the
end of an extended prologue, or to mark some other dramatic change of scene. The tads-io 
function set includea a <span class="code">clearscreen()</span> function for this purpose, and
you may well have been tempted to use it.

<p>You may also have come across the &lt;ABOUTBOX&gt; tag than can be used to create an about
box that displays when a player selects Help|About from an interpreter window. For example, 
the following would create a fairly general purpose plain-vanilla about box:

<p><div class="code"><pre>
"&lt;ABOUTBOX&gt;
 &lt;CENTER&gt;
 &lt;&lt;versionInfo.name.toUpper()&gt;&gt;\b
 &lt;&lt;versionInfo.byline&gt;&gt;\b
 Version &lt;&lt;versionInfo.version&gt;&gt;\b       
 &lt;/CENTER&gt;
 &lt;/ABOUTBOX&gt;";
</p></div>

<p>These seemingly disparate points are actually related. For if you have ever used 
<span class="code">clearscreen()</span> to clear the screen, you may have noticed that 
it causes your about box to disappear. Clearing the screen also clears the about box.

<p>There is a straightforward solution; you just need to do two things:
<ol>
<li>Don't use <span class="code">clearscreen()</span>; use the library function in
<span class="code">cls()</span> instead.</li>
<li><span class="code">Use gameMain.setAboutBox()</span> to define your about box, e.g.:
</ol>

<p><div class="code"><pre>
gameMain:GameMainDef
    initialPlayerChar = me

    setAboutBox()
    {
      "&lt;ABOUTBOX&gt;
       &lt;CENTER&gt;
       &lt;&lt;versionInfo.name.toUpper()&gt;&gt;\b
       &lt;&lt;versionInfo.byline&gt;&gt;\b
       Version &lt;&lt;versionInfo.version&gt;&gt;\b       
       &lt;/CENTER&gt;
       &lt;/ABOUTBOX&gt;";
    }
;
</p></div>

<p>There's a second and subtler reason why you should always use <span class="code">cls()</span>
rather than <span class="code">clearscreen()</span>; <span class="code">cls()</span>
flushes the transcript before clearing the screen, ensuring that any buffered reports
don't appear on the screen after it's been cleared.

<p>Finally, if you are intending to compile your game for the Web UI you <i>must</i> use <a span class="code">cls()</a> rather than <span class="code">clearscreen()</span>, since <span class="code">clearscreen()</span> is another tads-io function that won't work with the Web UI. Neither, for that matter, will <span class="code">&lt;ABOUTBOX&gt;</span>.

<h2>The mainOutputStream</h2>

<p>The complement to the inputManager object is the mainOutputStream object, which has a number of methods that can sometimes be useful. However, the situations in which they're likely to 
prove useful are rather less common than the ones we've been looking at up to now, and the
treatment of them is a bit more advanced. The main things we'll be discussing in this
section are how to capture the output of a routine (such a double-quoted string, or a method
that displays something) in a single-quoted string so we can examine it or manipulate it, and
how to test whether a routine actually output anything to the display. If these aren't of
any immediate interest you may want to skip to the final piece on <a href="#typo">
typographical quotes</a> right at the end.

<h3>captureOutput()</h3>

<p>Surprisingly enough, the <span class="code">captureOutput()</span> method allows you to
capture output (i.e. store what would have been output to the screen in a variable or property instead). To do this you can call 
<span class="code">mainOutputStream.captureOutput(func, [args])</span>. This takes a function
pointer as its first argument, and the arguments to that function (if any) as its remaining arguments. It returns the string that would have been output to the screen. The 'function
pointer' can typically be an anonymous function, and often a short-form one (if you're not
sure what that means, see the section on <a href="../sysman/anonfn.htm">Anonymous Functions</a>
in the <i>System Manual</i>).

<p>For example, the statement: 

<p><div class="code"><pre>
local utterance = mainOutputStream.captureOutput( 
                         {: "The rain in Spain stays mainly in the plain. " }); 
</div></p>

<p>Would result in <span class="code">utterance</span> containing the string 
'The rain in Spain stays mainly in the plain. ', without anything being output to the screen. 

<p>That particular example may not be particularly useful, but it serves to illustrate the
principle. To take develop a slightly more elaborate example, suppose we needed to get at the
value of a property defined as a double-quoted string, such as the desc property of a Thing, in order to manipulate it in some way. We might, for example, have defined a number of objects
like: 

<p><div class="code"><pre>
redBall: Thing 'red ball; big red round bouncy' 
  "It's a big bouncy object, red and round. " 
; 

blueBall: Thing  'blue ball; small blue round bouncy'
  "It's a small bouncy ball, blue and &lt;&lt;flattened ? 'flat' : 'round'&gt;&gt;"
  flattened = nil
;

</div></p>

<p>Now suppose that for some bizarre reason we need to construct a list of all the 
objects in our game whose descriptions contain the words 'round' and 'bouncy'. 
The problem is that there's no obvious way to manipulate double-quoted strings; the
only thing TADS 3 lets us do with them is display them. It's bad enough in the case
of the red ball, since TADS 3 provides no means of searching a double-quoted string 
for a substring; in the case of the blue ball it looks even trickier, since the blue 
ball's description depends on the value of its <span class="code">flattened</span> 
property. The way it's defined makes it effectively equivalent to a method for printing
different strings under different circumstances, and one can hardly look for a substring
of a method.

<p>But one can look for substrings in the output that a double-quoted string or
method would display. All we need do to do is to capture the output of these 
<span class="code">desc()</span> methods or properties in a single-quoted string,
which we can then manipulate. This can be achieved like so:


<p><div class="code"><pre>
roundBouncy()
{
  local vec = new Vector(10);
  
  forEachInstance(Thing, new function(obj) {
       local str = mainOutputStream.captureOutput({: obj.desc() });
       local toks = Tokenizer.tokenize(str);
       if(toks.indexWhich({tok: getTokOrig(tok) == 'round'})
         && toks.indexWhich({tok: getTokOrig(tok) == 'bouncy'}))
       {
         vec.append(obj);
       } 
   }
  );

  return vec.toList();
}
</div></p>

<p>Don't worry if you don't understand all this code; if some parts look a bit puzzling
they're probably the parts that are just providing shortcut ways to loop over collections
of objects and tokens to find the ones we want. The important thing is that we can use

<p><div class="code"><pre>
local str = mainOutputStream.captureOutput({: obj.desc() });
</p></div>

<p>to convert whatever <span class="code">obj.desc()</span> outputs into a single-quoted
string that we can then inspect and manipulate as we please.

<p>Note that if we know for sure that a property holds a simple double-quoted string, and not a method that prints a double-quoted string, or a double-quoted string that contains an embedded expression (with the &lt;&lt; &gt;&gt; syntax), then we could obtain the equivalent single-quoted string with:

<p><div class="code"><pre>
local str = obj.getMethod(&amp;desc);
</p></div>

<p>But if, as in the example above, we can't be sure that the property or method whose string value we want doesn't hold a method, then it's much safer to use the string capture technique just described.

<h3>watchForOutput()</h3>

<p>Another thing mainOutputStream can help with is determining whether anything has been output at all. For this you use its <span class="code">watchForOutput()</span> method. 
You use it by calling 
<span class="code">mainOutputStream.watchForOutput(func)</span>, which returns true if 
calling <span class="code">func()</span> caused something to be displayed and nil otherwise. 

<p>For example, suppose you define a class with a specialMessage property, which may contain
either a double-quoted string, or a routine that displays a string, or a single-quoted string, 
or a routine that returned a single-quoted string, or a number, and we want it displayed
appropriately whichever of these ways the property is defined. If specialMessage property
is a double-quoted string or a routine that prints a string, then all we need to do is
invoke it. If it contains a single-quoted string or a number, then we need to take further
action to display its contents. We could do it like this:

<p><div class="code"><pre>
 class SpecialThing : Thing  
    specialMessage = nil   
    showSpecialMessage   
    {   
      local val;   
      local hasDisplayed = mainOutputStream.watchForOutput( {: val = specialMessage } ); 
      if(!hasDisplayed)          
       switch(dataType(val))   
       {   
         case TypeSString:   
         case TypeInt: "&lt;&lt;val&gt;&gt;&lt;.p&gt;"; break;   
         case TypeTrue: "True<.p>"; break;   
         default: "Nothing to report. ";              
       }     
    }   
 ;  
  
 specialBall: SpecialThing 'ball'    
    specialMessage = "It's a special ball.&lt;.p&gt;"
 ;  
 
  
 specialStick: SpecialThing 'stick'   
    specialMessage = 'It\'s a stick. '   
 ;  
 
   
 specialNumber: SpecialThing 'number'  
    specialMessage = 532   
 ;  
 
  
 DefineIAction(Test)   
   execAction(c)   
   {   
     specialBall.showSpecialMessage;   
     specialStick.showSpecialMessage;  
     specialNumber.showSpecialMessage;   
   }   
 ;  
 
 
 VerbRule(Test)   
  'test'   
  : VerbProduction
  action = Test
 ;  
</p></div> 
  

<p>In this case, issuing the command TEST will result in the display: 

<pre>
   <b>&gt;test</b>
   It's a special ball.
   It's a stick. 
   532 
</pre>

<p>Although in this case we could have tested for <span class="code">dataType(val)</span> being
of kind <span class="code">TypeDString</span>, that wouldn't work in the more general case in 
which <span class="code">specialMessage</span> was a routine that may or may not display
 something, e.g: 

<p><div class="code"><pre>
 specialBall: SpecialThing 'ball'
    specialMessage   
     {   
       if(fooVal &lt; 2)   
         "It's an ordinary ball. ";   
       else if(fooVal == 2)     
         "It's a special ball.&amp;lt;.p&amp;gt;&quot;;   
       else if(fooVal &gt; 10)   
         "It's a very special ball. ";   
       return 'It\'s a moderately special ball. ';   
     }   
    fooVal = 4   
 ;  
</pre></div></p>
  

<p>In this highly artificial example, <span class="code">specialBall.specialMessage</span> always returns 'It\'s a moderately special ball. ' but may also display a different string as well depending on the value of <span class="code">specialBall.fooVal</span>. Calling 
<span class="code">specialBall.showSpecialMessage</span> will cause 'It\'s a moderately special
 ball. ' to be displayed if and only if <span class="code">fooVal</span> is between 3 and 9 inclusive; otherwise one of the other messages will be displayed instead. 

<h3>Output Filters</h3>

<p>If you look up the <span class="code">OutputManager</span> class in the <i>Library
Reference Manual</i> (or in output.t), you'll see that it has a number of methods for
adding and removing Output Filters: <span class="code">addOutputFilter(filter), 
addOutputFilterBelow (newFilter, existingFilter),</span> and
<span class="code">removeOutputFilter(filter)</span>. An OutputFilter is simply
an object that defines a <span class="code">filterText()</span> method that can
process any string passed to it and then pass it on to the next filter (or, finally,
to the display). Both <span class="code">captureOutput()</span> and
<span class="code">watchForOutput()</span> work by temporarily installing an OutputFilter
and then removing it again when it's done its job. The library also installs a number
of OutputFilters to carry out tasks such as managing the transcript and interpreting
style tags. For the most part you can leave the TADS 3 library to employ the OutputFilters
it uses automatically, and you may write dozens of TADS 3 games without ever worrying
about this mechanism.

<p>It may, however, be useful to know that it's there, just in case the time should
come when you want to manipulate the output in ways that go beyond what the normal
display mechanism offers (e.g. to summarize a series of action reports into one summary
report). This is not something we shall attempt to go into here; the point is just
to note that OutputFilters <i>may</i> turn out to be something you could use sometime
in the future.



<a name='preform'>
<h3>Displaying Preformatted Text</h3>
<p>Sometimes in a game it's useful to be able to dispay a diagram or picture made up from ordinary text characters, perhaps as a crude map, along the lines of:</p>
<pre>
+---   -----------
|    *         +  \
|    *     |   |   \
+-------------------
</pre>

<p>If we try to do this in TADS 3, however, we that find the normally helpful output formatting,
designed to produce good-looking textual output, will do its best to defeat us. In particular,
runs of consecutive dashes will be converted to m-dashes or n-dashes, and runs of consecutive
spaces will be converted to a single space.</p>

<p>The conversion of consecutive dashes into m-dashes and n-dashes is carried out by an
OutputFilter called the typograhicalOutputFilter. This in not the only OutputFilter that
might frustrate our efforts. We can bypass all the OutputFilters by ussing the function
<b>aoiSay(<i>txt</i>)</b>, but we still need a way to circumvent the effects of compressing
multiple spaces and having our diagram messed up by a variable spaced font.</p>

<p>The library function <b>showPreformatted(<i>lst</i>)</b> can handle all this for us, where <i>lst</i> is a list of strings we want displayed with line breaks between each element of the list. This allows us to display our diagram like this:</p>



<p><div class="code"><pre>
local diag = [
    '+---   -----------',
    '|    *         +  \\',
    '|    *     |   |   \\',
    '+-------------------'    
  ];
 
showPreformatted(lst)
</pre></div></p>

<p>In case you're wondering about the extra backslashes at the end of the second and third lines of <code>lst</code>, these are needed to produce a single backslash rather than having the backslash escape the closing single quote mark, as it would have done if we only had one backslash there.</p>

<p>We can also use <code>howPreformatted(<i>str</i>)</code> to display a single string, where <i>str</i> is supplied as a single-quoted string, for example:

<p><div class="code"><pre>
  showPreformatted('--- +++ *** ---');
</pre></div></p>
