<h1>Choosing a Conversation System</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Perhaps the most vexing problem of all in creating lifelike NPCs
is conversation.  This is the part of Interactive Fiction where the
immensity of the gap between modern software technology and
human-level intelligence becomes most apparent.  This is also the
problem that has made Artificial Intelligence research appear so
hopeless to so many people: despite decades of effort by top
scientists, not only has no one ever passed the deceptively
simple Turing Test, no one even truly knows where to begin.  A
significant, if unexpected, result from AI research has certainly been
that the workings of the human mind are vastly more subtle than they
at first appear.

<p>So what's a pragmatic IF author to do?  Clearly it's beyond our
reach to create characters that can engage the player in actual
conversations; the best we can hope to do is create the impression of
conversations - not the <i>illusion</i>, but the <i>impression</i>.
What do I mean by this?  I mean that we don't try to actually fool the
player into thinking our characters are real people, but rather
concentrate on giving the player the feeling of having a conversation
even though the player knows it's not real.

<p>Interactive Fiction authors have been grappling with this problem
since the format was invented.  Given that it's been somewhere around
thirty years (at the time of this writing) since the first adventure
games were created, and given that the conversation problem is far
from solved, it might seem that progress has been ridiculously slow.
I don't think that's evidence of a lack of creativity or effort on
the part of the IF community, though; I think it just goes to show
how hard a problem this is.

<p>We won't get into the actual programming details of implementing
conversations until the <a href='t3conv.htm'>next part of the
article</a>.  In this part, we look at conversation systems at the
design level.  We'll start with a survey of the main types of systems
that have been tried, with an eye to their strengths and weaknesses.
After that, I have some recommendations for authors thinking about
what kind of conversation system to use in their own games.

<h2><a name='survey'>Survey of IF conversation systems</a></h2>

<p>We start by looking at some of the conversation systems that
have been used in past works of Interactive Fiction.  This list
certainly isn't exhaustive, but it covers most of the systems that
have been widely used.

<p>IF occupies a wide, blurry band on the spectrum between completely
static fiction and full-blown "virtual reality" experiences, and it's
certainly not the case that every game aims for exactly the same kind
of effect.  In assessing the different conversation systems, I'm
obviously making certain assumptions about the kinds of effects the
game is trying to achieve.  A system that's terrible for one game
might be perfect for another.  So, you'll have to adjust my remarks
about what's good and bad about the different systems according to the
specific effects you're trying to achieve.


<h3>Cheap AI</h3>

<p>A few games (notably Douglas Adams' <i>Starship Titanic</i>) have
tried various "cheap AI" approaches.  That is, they try to create the
illusion that NPCs understand natural language input by disguising a
much simpler technique that's within the reach of modern software.
One such approach is "keyword" matching: tell the player to type
actual English sentences, then scan the input for certain meaningful
words, simply ignoring the sentence structure and any words that we
don't know.  A similar but slightly more sophisticated technique is
"regular expression" matching, along the lines of the classic "Eliza"
program (a simulated psychoanalyst that used textual templates to
recognize a number of basic sentence structures, then parroted back
the user's input, usually with some grammatical rearrangement based on
the templates).  

<p>In practice, this type of interface hasn't been very successful,
mostly because none of the known "cheap AI" techniques stands up to
even modest scrutiny.  Despite the naive appeal of keyword matching,
it suffers mightily from its lack of context sensitivity (minor
changes, like inserting the word "not" or rearranging a couple of
words, can completely change the meaning of a sentence), and also
fails to cope with simple problems like homonyms (more precisely,
homographs: words that are spelled the same way but have different
meanings).  Eliza-style regular expression matching is a poor fit to
the actual tree-like, highly recursive internal structure of natural
languages, so it fails when presented with anything beyond the
structures specifically enumerated by the programmer.

<p>The main problem with the cheap AI approaches is that players
quickly see through them.  Technically sophisticated players realize
at once what's really going on, and adjust their playing styles
accordingly; many <i>Starship Titanic</i> players report that they
started just entering individual keywords once they saw what the
parser was doing, because the parser became confused too easily when
a single input contained multiple keywords.  Technically
unsophisticated players might not be able to infer the internal
behavior; what they <i>will</i> do is decide that the program is buggy
because its responses are so obviously incongruous with their input.
Neither kind of player is fooled into thinking the program
understands what they're saying.  To my mind, if you can't
successfully fool the player, it's better not to try, because you're
expending your effort making the wrong thing good.  It's like hiring
an architect who usually builds airports to design your house: if she
spends a bunch of time making sure the baggage claim in the living
room is easy to use, it's a waste of effort, since you're never
actually going to claim baggage in your living room.  It's much
better to just tell the player up front how the program really works,
and then spend your effort making <i>that</i> experience good.

<p>An experimental system called <i>Fa&ccedil;ade</i>, by Michael
Mateas and Andrew Stern, uses a combination of AI techniques and
emotion-state modeling to create a sort of electronic improvisational
theater.  <i>Fa&ccedil;ade</i> has receive a lot of attention both
among IFers and in the broader game development community, and many
consider it groundbreaking.  The system's approach isn't exactly
"cheap" AI; it's more like mid-priced AI, in that it sticks to the
well-known conventional techniques of natural language parsing
(keyword matching, templates, grammatical parsing), but throws a ton
development effort at the problem: it seems to have a huge database of
keywords, templates, and grammar patterns that it tries to match.
Most people have been favorably impressed by the results, although the
system still won't truly fool anyone (i.e., it won't pass any Turing
tests).  If you hold out hope for an AI approach, you might or might
not take comfort from <i>Fa&ccedil;ade</i>; on the one hand, it seems
to show that conventional NLP techniques can yield incrementally
better results with incrementally more work, so it's not completely
pointless to try; on the other hand, it took a <i>lot</i> of work to
get the results they did, and they <i>still</i> aren't fooling anyone,
so you might conclude you're better off putting your effort into
something with a higher return on investment.


<h3>ASK/TELL</h3>

<p>The earliest IF conversation interface was probably
the ASK/TELL system, and this still seems to be the most widely used
style.  With the ASK/TELL system, the player converses with
characters using commands like ASK MAN ABOUT BACCARAT.

<p>A big advantage of the ASK/TELL system is that it integrates
smoothly with the rest of the user interface, in that conversational
commands have exactly the same format as any other command
(VERB-DOBJ-PREP-IOBJ).

<p>ASK/TELL is "open-ended," which is both good and bad, in varying
degrees to different people.  It's open-ended in the sense that there
are no apparent limits to what you can ask about; you can type
anything you like after the word ABOUT, after all.  This is good,
since it creates a feeling of boundless freedom for the player; but
it's bad, in that that freedom is an illusion.  The reality is that
only a limited number of pre-programmed topics actually have
interesting responses.  For many players, the illusion of boundless
freedom is quickly destroyed when ten topics in a row all return "I
don't know about that."  To some people, the invisibility of the
limits is good, separately from any illusion of freedom, in that it
maintains an "inductive" challenge rather than the purely deductive
one that would result from enumerating the valid inputs; to other
people, the same thing is bad in that it fosters "guess the noun"
puzzles that are as annoying as "guess the verb" puzzles are in normal
play.

<p>Another property of the ASK/TELL system is that it usually makes
for "stateless" conversations.  Each ASK/TELL command is essentially
a little self-contained interaction; we ask a question, the character
answers, and that's it.  Sometimes there's a small amount of context:
asking about the same topic repeatedly might elicit different
responses, for example.  However, this isn't usually true
<i>conversation</i> state, in that you could probably get the same
results by asking, doing something else, asking again, doing
something else again, and so on: all that matters is the number of
times you asked, not that you asked several times in a row.  This
statelessness is mostly a disadvantage, I think; with no continuity
from one ASK to the next, there's no sense of a conversation, just
these weird, unnatural, isolated fragments of conversation.  There's
also this strange sort of static familiarity: when we walk up to a
character for the first time, never having met the character before,
and ASK ABOUT something, the character just answers, as though
they've known us for years and as though we've been chatting for half
an hour already.  By the same token, talk with a character for half
an hour, ask an umpteenth question, and it's like we're meeting the
character for the first time.  There's an almost dream-like
surrealism to it, as though you're always waking up into a
conversation that's been going on forever and will keep going on
forever.  The only good thing about the stateless quality is that it
avoids the "menu maze" effect that can sometimes occur in menu-based
systems.

<p>Another substantial drawback of ASK/TELL is that it's difficult to
create the illusion of a natural conversation with such a limited
range of expression.  There's no way to agree or disagree with
something an NPC says; no way to greet, chastise, comfort, ridicule,
sympathize with, flatter, insult, thank, or apologize to a character;
no way to lie or be frank; no way even to express exactly what you
want to ASK or TELL someone about a given topic.  Some games have
experimented with adding verbs for some or all of these things:
THANK, INSULT, APOLOGIZE, COMFORT, JOKE, SMILE, FROWN, and on and on;
but in practice this ends up being almost like adding adverbs, in
that it does nothing but add an exploding number of new commands that
hardly ever do anything interesting.  And if guess-the-noun is a game
that's no fun, guess-the-noun-adverb-combo is positively hideous.

<h3>Menus</h3>

<p>Graphical adventures introduced menu-based UIs for
conversations many years ago, and text games have been experimenting
with this approach for a while now as well.  In most formulations,
the player initiates a conversation via some sort of TALK TO command
(which, in graphical games, might just be a matter of clicking on the
NPC), and is then presented with a list of options; the player
selects an option, the NPC responds, and a new list of options is
displayed.  This proceeds until the player chooses to end the
conversation or runs out of things to say.  The nature of the options
varies; in some games, it's a list of literal things for the player
character to say, and in others it's a list of topics.  In some text
formulations (notably some of Emily Short's work), the player has the
additional axis of control of switching to a different topic at any
time, using a free-form command akin to ASK.

<p>Menus gives authors two key elements of control lacking in ASK/TELL
systems.  First, a menu strictly limits the range of input; rather
than having to handle any possible ASK topic, at any given prompt we
only have to handle the set of three or four options that we
specifically enumerate at that prompt.  Second, because we're
enumerating the options, we're free to make the choices as detailed
and expressive as we want - we could offer options to ask the same
question in either understanding or accusing tones, for example.  We
<i>could</i> in principle do the same thing with ASK/TELL using
adverbs or something, but doing so would increase the already huge
search space to the point where we could never expect players to find
the few options we actually implement; with menus, this isn't a
problem, since the options are openly laid out for the player to
choose from.

<p>A major benefit of menu-based conversations is that it's
relatively easy to make menus stateful.  In most menu systems, after
we select an option from our current menu, we don't simply return to
the current menu - we go to an entirely new menu.  This allows the
author to create the effect of a thread of conversation, which is
almost always much more natural than the staccato fragments of
ASK/TELL.  The reason it's fairly easy to create threaded menu
conversations, but hard to create threaded ASK/TELL conversations,
boils down to the limited range of options at each point.  With
ASK/TELL, it's simply impractical to be able to thread to any topic
from any other topic; this would require anticipating (<i>topics</i>
<sup><i>queries</i></sup>) possible threadings, where <i>topics</i>
is the number of possible topics (i.e., indirect objects of ASK
ABOUT), and <i>queries</i> is the number of ASK commands in an entire
conversation.  Menu authors are faced with the exact same arithmetic,
but <i>topics</i> is replaced by <i>menu options</i>, which can
easily be kept at three or four without arousing any discomfort from
the player; this would be impractical for ASK/TELL, because limiting
the player to three or four valid ASK topics at a time would create
an unacceptable "guess the noun" game.  In practice, the expanse of
the menu tree is further reduced - vastly so - by looping (where a
branch leads back to a prior node) and converging (where several
branches lead to the same node).

<p>A disadvantage of the statefulness advantage is that it can create
a "menu maze" effect for players.  That is, players will sense that
the conversation menus form a graph of nodes, and they'll naturally
desire to exhaustively visit every node in the graph, but they won't
have a clear idea of how to navigate the graph because it's so
hidden.  My own experience as a player suggests that the best way to
avoid this problem is simply to avoid using menu-based conversations
as puzzles; in other words, don't hide anything important in branches
of a menu tree, but always put the vital information in "trunk" nodes
that all conversation paths eventually converge upon.  This approach
might seem to eliminate any challenge and make conversations useless,
but again, drawing from my own experience, I think it can improve the
feeling of interactivity by giving the player an enjoyable experience
threading through a conversation menu, but at the same time freeing
the player of any incentive to go back through the menu to
exhaustively map out the tree.  I personally find these sorts of
things a lot more satisfying if I'm not forced to treat them as
puzzle boxes to be disassembled.  Conversations can serve more important
purposes than just hiding puzzle solutions; they can flesh out
characters and develop the plot.

<p>Menus obviously constrain the player's options; this is both good
and bad.  It's good in that it eliminates any chance of a
guess-the-noun puzzle; players will never feel like they're hunting
around in the dark for the right keyword.  It's bad in that it brings
the mechanism so obviously to the foreground that players almost
can't help but approach it mechanistically.  It also makes the
boundaries of the game plain; many people find this undesirable
because it removes the illusion of boundless possibilities.  (A
free-form "topic switching" capability can mitigate the feeling of
being constrained to a few options, but it can't eliminate it
entirely; even if "or anything else" is always an option, the fact
that options "A" and "B" and "C" are enumerated can't help but call
attention to the existence of boundaries.)  I personally think that
the supposed "boundless" quality of text IF is overrated; I think a
big part of the reason that most people <i>don't</i> like text IF is
the stark contrast between the promise of "boundlessness" and the
reality of "I don't know that word."  I think most people approach a
text game with that wonderful promise of endless choices in their
minds, and after the fiftieth "you can't do that here" or "I don't
know that word" or "I don't know anything about that" they give up
and go play something with graphics and a sane UI.  Even so, a lot of
people who do like text IF say that the illusion of boundlessness is
a key reason why, so it's worth keeping this in mind when designing a
game.

<p>For all their good features, menus are a poor fit to the
conventional text IF user interface.  To me, this is a bigger
drawback than the illusory reduction in range of action.  The
fundamental problem is that menus are a multiple-choice test, and the
rest of the interface is an essay contest.  To me, the charm of the
free-form command UI isn't its supposed boundlessness (see rant
above); it's the subtle UI transparency, the illusion that you're not
operating a computer program at all but are just carrying on a
conversation with the story's narrator.  As I emphasized earlier,
it's not important that we actually fool the player into thinking
she's in a conversation with a human narrator; what's important is to
do nothing to jar the player out of her willing suspension of
disbelief.  Every menu UI I've seen in a text game involves some sort
of obvious break from the standard narrative output and command
input; the break calls attention to the UI and thereby degrades the
conversation-with-narrator experience.  Here's a summary of the menu
UIs that authors have tried:

<ul>

<li>The most common approach is to show a numbered list of choices,
with one choice per line for readability.  You get a special prompt
at which you type the number of your selection.  This is bad on two
counts: the list of options is not prose rendered in the narrator's
voice, so it doesn't fit in with the rest of the transcript, and the
input of a numbered choice doesn't fit with the usual command input
format.  The special prompt is bad on the general UI design grounds
that modal interfaces are bad except under specific conditions that
do not apply in this case.

<li>Recognizing the incongruity of the numbered list, some authors
render the list in a separate window on interpreters that can support
such UI tricks.  This helps a little, by taking the list out of the
transcript.  It doesn't solve the input problem, and it doesn't truly
address the main problem, which is that there's a special UI at all.
It is arguably a <i>better</i> special UI than the in-line numbered
list, but it's still a special UI.

<li>Some games use a standard command input prompt rather than a
special prompt.  Entering a number at the prompt selects a menu;
anything else is treated as a normal command.  This eliminates the
modality problem, but doesn't address the exceptional input format
or the unsightly numbered list.

<li>Kathleen M. Fischer's <i>Redemption</i> introduced an interesting
variation.  Rather than using a numbered list, the game shows a brief
list of options, in paragraph form - something like "...ask about
Malcolm, agree, disagree, or tell him to leave."  At the prompt, the
player enters one of the keywords from the desired option - so to
choose "tell him to leave" we might type "leave."  Although there's
still a list of options displayed, it almost fits in with the
surrounding narrative text; at a glance, it certainly doesn't stand
out the way a numbered list or a separate window does.  In addition,
by using keywords as the player input, there's superfically a feeling
of entering an ordinary command rather than a number from a
multiple-choice list.  It's almost as though the list of options is a
little gentle guidance from the narrator, as though we <i>could</i>
type anything else we wanted, but we choose not to.  The one failing
of the system as implemented in <i>Redemption</i> is that the input
prompt at these menus is modal.  With a modeless prompt (so that we
could either choose a menu keyword or enter any ordinary command),
the system might well address most of the UI drawbacks I see in menu
systems.

</ul>

<h3>Hyperlinked replies</h3>

<p>A variation on the menu system is to show options as keywords,
using some distinctive visual style, embedded within an NPC's
responses.  So, you ask the villager about the cave, and the villager
replies "Don't go in that cave!  There are all sorts of
<b>monsters</b> there!  But also <b>legends</b> of a great treasure!"
The keywords are topics for subsequent ASK commands.  A number of RPGs
have used this technique (RPG = Role-Playing Game, which is actually a
much narrower niche than you'd think from the name; in industry
parlance, RPG almost always means something with D&amp;D-derived rules
and a particular kind of UI).  The usual UI involves essentially
hyperlinks: some of the words in the NPC's response to a query will be
highlighted visually, and clicking on one of the highlighted words
asks the NPC about that word, which elicits another response with more
highlighted keywords, etc.

<p>This style is almost exactly like menu-based conversations; the
only real difference is in how the UI is presented.  (Interestingly,
I don't think I've seen it used in a text game, even though it's been
used in numerous RPGs.)  Apart from the practical problem that some
interpreter platforms might be unable to show a special visual
appearance for the keywords, this approach would seem to have the
same sort of problems as other menu-based UIs.  In particular, the
special highlighted appearance of the keywords would be an obvious
intrusion of the UI into the narrative text.  It also suffers from
one of the big problems with ASK/TELL: it's impossible to express any
thought beyond "WHAT IS (X)?"

<h3>Menu-less TALK TO</h3>

<p>Back in the old days of MS-DOS software, product managers spent a
lot of time worrying about how difficult the installation process
tended to be.  The buzzword of the time, and the sort of holy grail
of product managers, was the "one-button install" - an installation
process so simple that the user just had to click on the button that
said "install."  It always seemed to me that if you could get the
install down to one button, then they ought to just push it at the
factory and give the user a zero-button install.

<p>Some authors have taken a similar sort of tack with conversation
systems.  The idea is to take the key feature of menus - limiting input
options to an enumerated set - to its logical extreme, which is to
reduce each menu to a single option.  Once a menu has only one
option, we can dispense with the menu entirely, since there's no need
to solicit player input when there's no choice to be made.  This
eliminates the user interface problems of menu systems, while
retaining some of the main benefits: the player doesn't play
guess-the-noun, the author has control over the range of options, and
the options (well, option, singular) can be arbitrarily detailed and
expressive.

<p>Several games have taken this route, notably Ian Finley's
<i>Kaged</i> and Stephen Granade's <i>Common Ground</i>.  In concrete
terms, conversations look something like this:

<p><pre>
  &gt;talk to bob
  "I was out at the lighthouse today," you start.

  Bob looks extremely flustered.  "What are you talking about?"
  he asks.  "They tore that place down years ago, after the...
  troubles."
</pre>

<p>In other words, the player initiates a conversation, but has no
control over what the player character says.  A single TALK TO
command typically invokes a single exchange; to continue the
conversation, the player would enter a new TALK TO command.  As with
menu systems, this approach constrains the problem space to an extent
that allows for a great deal of awareness of context - the player
character can say specific things that are appropriate to the plot
and character development, and conversations can follow a subject
thread.

<p>This approach has received a mixed reception from reviewers.
Obviously, it trades off a lot of interactivity for the increased
authorial control, which some people hate and others don't mind so
much.  It doesn't <i>completely</i> remove the player's control,
since the player can choose to talk or not, and can continue with a
conversation or not; but even so, the reduction in control is so
drastic that players cannot help but notice.  My own experience with
games using this sort of system is that it can make for natural,
realistic conversations, just as menus can, but that there's
something too distancing about it.  It's perhaps too similar to
finding a diary in the game and reading it: it can give us
interesting background material, but it's more like reading about a
conversation than participating in it.

<h3>Other Approaches</h3>

<p>There are a few other approaches worth mentioning.  These are less
widely used or less generally applicable than the systems we've
already talked about, but merit at least a passing mention.

<p>A game without NPCs solves the conversation problem by bypassing
it entirely.  As such, "no conversation system" isn't exactly a type
of conversation system, but it could be considered a solution of
sorts to the problem if only because it's one that a lot of authors
have used.  

<p>A few authors have tried interactions based on emotions rather than
topic-like information.  Rather than verbs like ASK, TELL, GIVE, and
SHOW, we might have verbs such as HAPPY, SAD, POUT, FLATTER; or we
might have adverbial variations of conversational gestures, such as
GREET WARMLY or GREET SUSPICIOUSLY.  Characters are modeled as emotion
state machines, and the game is in pushing the characters through
their emotional mazes to some desired goal.  There has yet to be a
truly successful example of this approach.  The closest, and most
ambitious, is probably Chris Crawford's <i>Erasmatron</i>.  Many IFers
who've looked at <i>Erasmatron</i> consider it a failure that proves
that this approach won't work (the main sample game produces results
that are so bizarre and incoherent that it became a running joke in
the IF newgroups for a while); Crawford's supporters counter that the
engine has potential that hasn't been properly tapped in example work
yet.  Adam Cadre's <i>Varicella</i> uses a sort of hybrid of emotions
and conventional ASK/TELL, allowing the player to choose a tone of
voice for each question.  But the range of tones is quite limited (to
three possibilities), and the effect seems mostly superficial; in
fact, if the range of tones weren't so limited or the effect were
anything other than superficial, the exploding number of possibilities
would probably make the game impossibly difficult (both for the author
to write and for the player to play).

<p>ASK/TELL systems sometimes make me feel like I'm in a foreign land
where I don't speak the language, and my only way to communicate is to
point at things - a crippingly limited mode of expression.  Sometimes,
though, a story actually <i>is</i> set in a foreign land, or it's set
on an alien planet, or the player character is autistic, or there's
some other good story-rooted reason that the player character can't
communicate straightforwardly with the story's other characters.  In
these cases, the limitations of IF conversational systems can actually
work to the game's advantage.  Lucian P. Smith's <i>Edifice</i> uses
this to good effect.  Obviously, though, this technique has limited
applicability.

<p>Andrew Plotkin's <i>Spider and Web</i> uses a possibly unique
approach that essentially inverts the typical ASK/TELL style: rather
than the PC peppering NPCs with questions, an NPC asks the questions
and the PC answers.  The trick is that the questions are all of the
YES/NO variety, so the range of player input that the parser has to
understand is neatly limited.  This could certainly be extended to
multiple-choice answers ("Which one do you like better, the blue one
or the green one?"), but even so, it's hardly a general-purpose
conversation system; it requires a degree of contrivance in the game
structure that severely limits its reusability.


<h2><a name='recommendations'>Recommendations</a></h2>

<p>As you might have noticed, I have some opinions about what works
and what doesn't in the various conversation systems.  In a moment,
I'll distill these down into some recommendations.  First, though, I
want to emphasize that these are only suggestions.  Conversation
systems are very much a matter of taste, and there are plenty of
people who like the exact opposite of what I do.  Also, the
conversation system that's best for a given game depends a lot on the
nature of the game, so my one-size-fits-all advice has to be adjusted
accordingly.  And most importantly, no one's actually figured out how
to build a perfect conversation system yet, so the last thing I'd want
to do is stop people from trying new ideas - some of my suggestions
borrow from pretty recent games, so I don't think we've come near to
exhausting the possibilities yet.  If you have a scheme of your own
that don't fit any of the established patterns, and you think it has
advantages over the existing systems, then by all means ignore my
recommendations and show us a better way.

<p>So, on to my recommendations.

<p>Much as I like the way menus can create the sense of a real
conversation, I'd recommend against using the sort of menus that
graphical games use.  An enumeration of options is just not a good
fit to the look or the feel of a text game.  The text IF user
interface demands something that can be rendered in the narrator's
voice, and something that at least feels more open-ended.  The
menu-less TALK TO is really a degenerate case of menus, so I'd
recommend against it as well.  I'd also stay well away from "cheap
AI" systems, since they don't fool anyone, and don't have much to
recommend them apart from the false promise of fooling players.

<p>What this leaves us with is ASK/TELL.  Despite the drawbacks,
ASK/TELL is what I'd recommend - but with a few differences from the
conventional system.

<h3>Use full exchanges</h3>

<p>First, I recommend rendering each
ASK/TELL as a full exchange, with both the player character's question
and the NPC's answer explicitly stated.  The traditional ASK/TELL
system looks like this:

<p><pre>
  &gt;ask bob about antenna
  "I climbed it once.  It's pretty scary up there."
</pre>

<p>Instead, I'd render the exchange like this:

<p><pre>
  &gt;ask bob about antenna
  "Have you been to the antenna?" you ask.

  "I climbed it once," Bob says.  "It's pretty scary up there.
  Great view of the city, though."
</pre>

<p>It's a subtle difference, but an important one.  The traditional
style elides the player character's actual words, showing only the
NPC's response.  This is in keeping with the traditional view that the
player character is literally the player, in which case the player
character's actual words have to be left unsaid, since we can't
pretend to know the exact words the player means to say.  In the more
modern view, the player character is distinct from the player and
<i>should</i> have a well-defined personality.  Conversation is a
great opportunity to flesh out this characterization.  What's more,
with a player character who's distinct from the player, it's
incongruous <i>not</i> to show the character's half of the
conversation, since that implies that the character's words are
literally "ask bob about antenna," or perhaps just "Antenna?"

<h3>Use hellos and goodbyes</h3>

<p>I would consider giving some conversations a beginning and an end.
This doesn't mean that you have to create a complex protocol that
players have to follow; instead, it means that your NPCs treat
"conversing with player" as a separate state, and add appropriate
remarks when switching to and from this conversation state.  Here's
the effect I have in mind:

<p><pre>
  &gt;ask bob about antenna
  "Excuse me..."

  Bob looks up from his ledger and takes off his glasses.  "Yes?"

  "Have you been to the antenna?" you ask.

  "I climbed it once," Bob says.  "It's pretty scary up there.
  Great view of the city, though."

  &gt;ask about view
  "What could you see from the antenna?"

  "Well," Bob says, "I remember being able to see all the way out
  to the lighthouse."

  &gt;east
  Bob turns his attention back to his ledger.

  <b>Main Street</b>
  The street is deserted, as usual for these days. [...]
</pre>

<h3>Use "threading"</h3>

<p>Even with ASK/TELL, we could provide some simple "threading" in
certain cases - that is, we can recognize obvious follow-up questions,
such as the ASK ABOUT VIEW in the example above.  It's impractical to
do this to the extent you would in a menu system, but it's still
possible to do some of the time.  The trick is to recognize cases
where a subject thread is so strong that the player will just
naturally follow it.  Remember: the player is talking to the NPC
because they want some specific information, which you've set them up
to want in the first place through the goals you created for the
player.  An NPC response to one question can raise a new question in
such a way that the player will naturally want to ask it: "I don't
know about the idol, but I heard an interesting rumor about your
friend Dr. Philips"; or, "the idol is in the Chamber of Dung Beetles,"
and then "They say you need the Scroll of Tuht-Ro to get into the
Chamber."  You don't need bright blue hyperlinked text to guess what
to ASK ABOUT next in responses like these.

<p>A warning about threaded conversations is in order, though:
don't overuse them, and don't use these conversation "branches" to
hide critical information.  The "menu maze" effect is highly
undesirable - and a maze of free-form ASK/TELLs would be far worse
than a maze of multiple-choice menu entries.  Conversations are best
used, I think, for characterization and plot development; they're not
a great place to put puzzles, because they're too prone to becoming
guess-the-noun puzzles.  Adding puzzles that depend on correct
navigation of branching conversations would exponentially compound
this problem by creating guess-the-<b>series</b>-of-nouns puzzles;
this would be almost unthinkably awful.

<h3>Use a "topic inventory"</h3>

<p>If guess-the-noun and guess-the-series-of-nouns puzzles are bad,
how do we avoid them without dropping the whole ASK/TELL approach?
One simple way is to avoid using conversation as a source of puzzles;
this way, if players miss a few topics or a few thread paths, it won't
prevent them from advancing in the game.  Another approach is to
provide some guidance.  Menus are one way to provide guidance, but
I've explained why I don't think they're quite right for text games.
As an alternative to menus, I suggest something I call "topic
inventory."

<p>The topic inventory is essentially a list of suggested topics for
ASK or TELL commands.  It's not an exhaustive list of possible topics;
it's just a list of topics that the player character is interested in
knowing about.  Some might object that this is presumptuous: how would
the game know what the player is curious about?  But that's not it at
all: if the player character is distinct from the player, then it's
the <i>player character</i> to whom we're attributing the curiosity.

<p>In concrete terms, the topic inventory might be presented like this:

<p><pre>
  &gt;talk to bob
  "Excuse me..."

  Bob looks up from his ledger and takes off his glasses.  "Yes?"

  (You could ask about the antenna, or tell him about the lighthouse
  or the giant rat.)

  &gt;tell about lighthouse
  "I was in the lighthouse earlier today," you start.

  Bob becomes quite flustered.  "What are you talking about?  That
  thing was torn down years ago, after the... troubles."

  &gt;topics
  (You could ask about the antenna, or the troubles, or tell him
  about the giant rat.)
</pre>

<p>This is the least tested of my suggested extensions to the
traditional ASK/TELL system, and you might have some reservations
about it.  I'll try to address a few of the potential drawbacks.

<p><b>Wouldn't a topic inventory eliminate the challenge, like
menus?</b> Maybe, but probably not.  Unlike menus, the topic inventory
doesn't promise to be complete; it only lists suggested topics, not
every possible topic.  The author gets to decide what to suggest, so
if a suggestion is too leading, the author can leave it out.  Further,
the library won't show the topics automatically on every turn the way
menus are; the topic inventory will be displayed only when the game's
author decides to show it for some reason, or the user explicitly asks
for it.

<p>In addition, there's a deeper game-design reason why a topic
inventory shouldn't harm the challenge: guessing the magic topic
shouldn't have been a source of challenge in the first place.
Guess-the-topic puzzles are just as bad as guess-the-verb puzzles.  In
this sense, the topic inventory is a useful design tool: if you resist
revealing a topic in the inventory because it would give away too
much, you have to ask yourself if it was such a good idea to put such
a big revelation into the topic in the first place.  In these cases,
maybe you can find a way to add more conversation topics that
eventually lead the player to the big revelation topic; this way the
player still has to dig a bit to find the magic topic, but there's a
way to find it other than pure guesswork.

<p>From the author's perspective, I think the reduction in topic
obscurity will be more beneficial than harmful.  Any dilution of
puzzle difficulty could be more than offset by an increase in
conversational range.  With a conventional ASK/TELL system, authors
have to be careful not to put too much information in conversations,
lest players become frustrated by guess-the-noun puzzles.  With a
topic inventory, authors would be free to include topics that are much
more subtle, knowing that players will be able to find them.

<p>From the player's perspective, the topic inventory could be viewed
almost as mild hints.  For the most part, the game won't suggest
topics except when asked to, so a hard-core puzzle solver could always
bypass the topic suggestions.

<p><b>Won't players just type TOPICS at every turn?</b> Again, maybe
but probably not.  First, if there are a few things in one topic
inventory list, players will probably at least try each of those
before asking again.  Second, topics usually won't come and go at
every juncture; even in the densest menu system, the majority of
branches will be dead ends, since this is the only way that the
otherwise exponential growth of the tree can be contained.  Players
who do start typing TOPICS at every prompt will usually find this
behavior unrewarded, and they'll quickly stop bothering.  Third, even
when one topic does lead to another that leads to another, if the game
is decently written, the chain of questions will be implied in the
responses anyway.  Typing TOPICS again when another topic is clearly
implied in the response is wasted effort that players will naturally
bypass.

<p>It remains to be seen until we get more experience with this
scheme, but I expect that players will only ask for TOPICS once in a
while, when they're stuck.  As long as they're making progress, they
won't feel the need to ask for a topic list, and the overhead (however
small) of typing the extra command will serve as a natural barrier to
overuse.

<p>There's one important game design implication to keep in mind,
though.  If the player ever discovers that typing TOPICS at one
crucial moment would have solved a puzzle, but failing to do so
resulted in a missed opportunity, then the player will become very
annoyed and <i>will</i> start typing TOPICS at every prompt.  This is
a matter of trust.  The TOPICS command can't be used a substitute for
proper hinting, and it can't be the sole way for the player to learn
about a topic.  Every time a player looks at a topic inventory list,
the player should recognize everything on the list - the reaction
should always be "oh, of course," never "where the heck did
<i>that</i> come from?"

<p>If you're creating a conversation where there are special things
the player can say in the context of certain points in the
conversation, the game should flat out tell the player about these
special things.  Here's an example:

<p><pre>
  &gt;ask about troubles
  "What 'troubles' are you talking about?"

  Bob turns his back on you and pretends to go back to his sweeping,
  obviously very agitated.

  (You could ask about the troubles again, or tell him about the
  newspaper article.)

  &gt;tell about article
  You lower your voice.  "I found a newspaper article from 1967 about
  the murder trial.  I saw you in the photo of the jury."
</pre>

<p>This works toward developing the trust we need from the player.  If
the player comes to expect us to offer a topic list at these special
junctures, they'll trust us not to sneak in special junctures without
the listings.

<h3>Let NPCs drive once in a while</h3>

<p>One of the many strange things about ASK/TELL conversations is the
almost invariably passive role of the NPC.  Seemingly their only role
is to sit there and wait for the player to ask them something.  Using
actor states and hello/goodbye protocols can help reduce this effect,
but even with these enhancements, ASK/TELL conversations are still too
obviously one-sided interrogations.  So, why not let the NPC drive
once in a while?

<p>The biggest obstacle to letting the NPC take charge is that the
player's expressive range is so limited.  But it's not completely
empty: we can answer yes-or-no questions, and we can TELL ABOUT
topics.  We can also GIVE and SHOW things to the NPC.

<p>Beyond these standard options, we could use the topic inventory to
provide non-standard options for individual interactions.  So, you
could occasionally add special, one-time-only commands (AGREE,
DISAGREE, LAUGH, APOLOGIZE, or anything else you want), and let the
player know when these are available via a topic inventory.  The
important thing to realize is that these would not be new commands
that the player could use at any time; they'd essentially just be menu
choices, each one working only at its proper moment.  They wouldn't be
guesswork for the player, since we'd show the topic inventory to let
the player know about the special options.

<p>As with any conversational threading, letting the NPC ask questions
requires a certain delicacy.  In particular, you have to be sure that
it's very clear to the player that they're meant to respond.  Make sure
it's clear that the NPC's question isn't rhetorical.  Offering a
topic inventory is a good way to make this more obvious.

<h3>Provide good default responses</h3>

<p>When it comes to responding to ASK topics, the more your NPCs can
handle, the better.  But you'll never be able to think of everything,
no matter how hard you try or how many beta-testers you have.  This is
an area where the vast creativity and power of the human mind work
against you - the problem being the vast creativity and power of your
<i>players'</i> minds.  The fact is that players are going to think of
things to ASK and TELL about - lots and lots of things - that would
never have occurred to you.  And even if you put in responses to all
of those things, <i>other</i> players will think of even more things.

<p>When a player enters an ASK or TELL command about a topic you
haven't anticipated, they're going to get what's known as a "default
response."  That's the fall-back, general-purpose response your
character uses when you haven't programmed anything specific for the
topic.  There are two important facts about default messages:

<ul>
  <li>The player is going to see them many times.
  <li>The player is going to see them in response to topics that
  seem perfectly logical to the player.
</ul>

<p>A lot of people think that that first item can be changed by
sufficient application of virtuous effort.  It usually can't.
Virtuous effort can reduce the number of times a player will see
default messages, but in a game of any real size, it's darn near
impossible to reduce it below "many."  The problem is that, at some
point in almost any game, the player will get stuck, and one of the
ways they'll try to get unstuck is to ask each NPC about everything
they can think of.

<p>The second item is a bit more subtle.  There's a corollary to the
virtuous effort postulate: if you've covered all of the reasonable
questions, then clearly, any questions you haven't covered are
unreasonable.  But covering all of the reasonable questions isn't
a practical possibility, in my view, so there will inevitably be
topics that seem perfectly reasonable to the player but that aren't
covered.

<p>These two facts imply two properties that default messages should
have.

<p>First, the defaults should have some variety.  If the player is
going to see default messages repeatedly, then at least you can make
them a little less boring, and a little less obviously mechanical, by
providing more than one.  This is especially important for those times
when the player is hammering away at an NPC trying to find the magic
ASK ABOUT phrase that turns up some interesting information, because
the player will likely see the default response several times in a row
at these times.  A simple but effective trick is to define three or
four responses (or even more, for an important NPC), and select one
randomly each time a response is needed.

<p>Second, the defaults shouldn't suggest that the NPC doesn't know
about the topic.  The problem with saying "I don't know about that"
is that it's likely to obvious nonsense.  For example, players might
ask about something completely off the wall in terms of the game but
completely logical in terms of real people; they might ASK ABOUT HIS
MOTHER or ASK ABOUT HIGH SCHOOL or something else that's irrelevant
to the game but is perfectly relevant to the NPC in a broader
cultural context.  "I don't know about that" just doesn't make any
sense in these cases.

<p>There's a third important property for default responses: the
messages shouldn't mislead the player into thinking that the absence
of a useful reply is itself a puzzle.  This property isn't a
consequence of the frequency of use of these responses, but rather is
a matter of good game design.  Players are prone to interpreting any
obstacle in the game as a puzzle, so you have to be careful not to
make the NPC's response look like an obstacle.  Using a "topic
inventory" as described earlier can be a great help here - by giving
the player a few topics for which the NPC does respond, you'll show
the player immediately that the NPC isn't completely unresponsive,
which will guide the player away from thinking that the NPC's help
depends on solving a puzzle.

<p>It's hard to provide a good response in general that conveys "I am
not programmed to respond in that area" without sounding like "I am
not programmed to respond in that area," and without sounding stupid
in cases like ASK ABOUT HIS MOTHER.  That's why the library uses the
rather bland "There's no response."  Depending on the character, you
could use a slightly more informative response like "I don't have
anything interesting to tell you about that" or "I'd rather not talk
about that," but these responses run almost the same risk of sounding
ridiculous as "I don't know about that" for some topics.

<p>My recommendation is to use unresponsiveness rather than
cluelessness, and to use something that's appropriate to the
character.  If the character is preoccupied with something, say that
the character is too lost in thought or too busy fiddling with
something to respond.  If the character is hostile, have it just
glare, or hurl an insult, or refuse to answer out of sheer orneriness.
Used this way, default responses can be a good opportunity to flesh
out a character, so at least they're not a complete waste for the
player.
