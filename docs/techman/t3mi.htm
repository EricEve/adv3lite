<h1>Multiple Inheritance</h1>

<p><i>by Eric Eve</i>

<p>The inheritance mechanism in TADS 3 (also described in the 
<a href="../sysman/inherit.htm">System Manual</a>) is not only extremely useful, 
but essential to how the library works, and it's impossible 
to get very far writing a game in TADS 3 without making use of it, not 
only through defining objects belonging to classes that rely on the inheritance 
mechanism, but through using the <b>inherited</b> keyword in your own code.

<p>At first sight this may seem straightforward enough. Suppose class B is derived 
from class A and that class A (but not class B) directly defines the property 
(or method) foo(). One might then expect that calling B.foo() would always invoke 
A.foo(). One might also expect that if, conversely, B overrode foo() and used the 
keyword <b>inherited</b> in its version of foo(), <b>inherited</b> would refer to A's version of 
foo. Unfortunately it's not quite that simple. Suppose we have the following object 
definition:

<pre>
bar: B, C
;
</pre>

<p>Where, as before, B derives from A, and A (but not B) directly defines the method foo(). 
Now suppose our code invokes the method bar.foo(). It may seem obvious that bar.foo() will 
use class A's foo() method, but this may be incorrect. If C is also derived from A, and C 
(but not B) overrides foo(), then bar.foo() would use C's foo() method, not A's. Moreover if 
B and C are both derived from A and both override foo(), but B's overridden foo() includes 
the <b>inherited</b> keyword, then when bar.foo() is invoked, inherited in B.foo() will 
call C.foo(),not A.foo() as one might at first expect.

<p>If, on the other hand, C does not derive from A (but B does) or C does not define or 
override foo(), then a call to bar.foo() will invoke A.foo() in either of these cases. 
That is, in the event that C does not override A.foo(), (either because it is not derived 
from A, or because it does not define a foo() method, or both), then if B does not 
override foo(), bar.foo() will use A.foo(), or if B does override foo() and B.foo() 
uses the <b>inherited</b> keyword, then in this context the inherited in B.foo() will invoke 
A.foo().

<p>It follows that the precise reference of <b>inherited</b> is context dependent. In particular 
suppose we have a definition like the following:

<pre>
class B: A
   foo()
   {
       inherited();
       "B.foo() is now executing. ";
    }
;
</pre>

<p>This definition does not determine which class's foo() method will be invoked
 at run-time by the call to inherited() within B.foo(). Under some circumstances 
 it may be A. Under others it may be a subclass of A that overrides foo(). 

<p>If you look at the definition of <b>inherited</b> in the 'Expressions and Operators' page 
of the <i>System Manual</i>, you'll see that it does <b>not</b> say "The inherited operator invokes 
the equivalent method from the current class's superclass" but rather "The inherited 
operator invokes the method that the currently executing method overrides". In other 
words, inherited invokes the method (or property) that would have been invoked if the
current method (or property) had not been overridden on the current class or object.
Thus, in the above example, determining which method is invoked by a call to bar.foo() 
when B does not override foo is the same as determing which method is invoked, in the
course of executing bar.foo, by inherited within B.foo() when B does override foo. 

<p>Let's pause to consider the rationale of this, approaching it through the 
conceptually simpler case of determining which class's definition of foo is 
invoked by a call to bar.foo() when B does <b>not</b> define or override foo(). Again, 
we shall start simply from this definition of bar:

<pre>
bar: B, C
;
</pre>

<p>Now let's consider what we'd <i>expect</i> to happen in a couple of cases.

<p>(1) Suppose foo is defined on B or one of its ancestor classes but not on C or 
any of its ancestor classes. Then we'd surely expect bar.foo to invoke the version 
of foo defined or overridden on B or inherited by B from one of its ancestor classes, 
and this is in fact what happens.

<p>(2) Suppose foo is not defined on B or on any of B's ancestor classes, but is 
defined on C or inherited by C from one of C's ancestor classes. Then we'd expect bar.foo() 
to invoke C's (overridden or inherited) version of foo. Presumably, that was part of the 
point of including C in bar's superclass list. And again, this is what happens.

<p>(3) Suppose foo is defined or overridden on both B and C. Then we'd expect bar.foo() 
to use B.foo(), since a method defined on an earlier class in this list effectively
 overrides one defined later. Indeed, this follows from what the Object Definition 
 section of the <i>System Manual</i> tells us, namely "If you specify more than one superclass,
 the order of the classes determines the inheritance order. The first (left-most) 
 superclass has precedence for inheritance, so any properties or methods that it defines 
 effectively override the same properties and methods defined in subsequent superclasses." 
 And again, this is what in fact actually happens.
 
<p>(4) Finally suppose B inherits foo() from A without overriding it, and C also inherits
 or overrides foo(). You might suppose that this was effectively the same as case 3 above, 
 and that since class B has precedence over class C in the class list (since it comes before
  it) the version of foo() inherited by B will prevail, with the result that bar.foo() will 
  invoke A.foo() (i.e. the version of foo() that B inherits from A), but <i>this is not 
  necessarily the case</i>. In particular, it is not the case if C.foo() overrides A.foo(), 
  or if C.foo() inherits a version of foo() that overrides A.foo(). If neither of these 
  conditions is met, then bar.foo() will indeed invoke A.foo(), otherwise, if C.foo() 
  directly or indirectly overrides A.foo(), then bar.foo() will invoke C.foo(), not A.foo().

<p>It is probably this last case that seems the least intuitive and the most potentially 
confusing. The rationale behind it is that if C.foo() overrides A.foo() (either directly or 
through an intermediary class in the class hierarchy), C's foo() method is more specialized 
than A's, so that if C appears in a superclass list, it's probably the behaviour of C.foo() 
we want rather than that of A.foo(), even if C appears later in the class list than a class 
that inherits (but does override) A.foo() - presumably the whole point of including C rather 
than A in the superclass list is that we wanted C's specialization of A, not just A itself. 
To anticipate an example we'll return to <a href='#conv'>below</a>, if A is AgendaItem, 
B is DelayedAgendaItem 
and C is ConvAgendaItem, then the fact that we added ConvAgendaItem to the class list 
presumably means we want something it provides beyond what DelayedAgendaItem already inherits
from AgendaItem, so that in this contect it makes better sense for <b>inherited</b> in
DelayedAgendaItem.isReady to refer to ConvAgendaItem.isReady than to AgendaItem.isReady.  

<p>Bear in mind that it is possible to override this behaviour if it isn't what we want. 
If we wanted <b>inherited</b> in B.foo() <i>always</i> to reference A.foo() no matter what the 
context, we could add the classname A after the inherited keyword to ensure this result:

<pre>
class B: A
   foo()
   {
       inherited A();
       "B.foo() is now executing. ";
    }
;
</pre>

<p>Indeed, there doubtless are cases where this is necessary to get the result we actually 
want, but it's probably a minority of cases. In practice, it usually turns out that the 
default mechanism described above does what is most useful. This mechanism is the rule 
summarized rather densely (originally in the TADS 2 manual, and subsequently quoted in 
<i>Getting Started in TADS 3</i>) as "the inherited property in the case of multiple 
inheritance is that property of the earliest (leftmost) superclass in the object's 
superclass list that is not overridden by a subsequent superclass." Another way of putting 
this is to say that "The first (left-most) superclass has precedence for inheritance, 
so any properties or methods that it defines effectively override the same properties 
and methods defined in subsequent superclasses, except that an ancestor class does not 
override a method or property on any of its descendent classes."
 
<p>Below we shall introduce a straightforward <a href='#algorithm'>algorithm</a> for determining
the order of precedence in situations of multiple inheritance, but first let's look at a
few more examples.
 
<h2>An Abstract Example</h2>

<p>Suppose we have the following class hierarchy:

<pre><font color=blue>
                    object
                    /     \
                   A       C
                  /  \      \
                 B    D      E

</font></pre>

<p>Suppose further that these classes are defined thus:

<pre>
class A: object
  hello() { "Hello from class A! "; }
  foo = "\nA foo" 
;

class B: A
  hello()
  {
     inherited;     
     "Hello from class B! ";
  }  
;

class C: object
  hello()
  {
     inherited;     
     "Hello from class C! ";
  }
  foo = "\nC foo"
; 

class D: A
  hello()
  {
     inherited;     
     "Hello from class D! ";
  }
  foo = "\nD foo"
;

class E: C
  hello()
  {
     inherited;     
     "Hello from class E! ";
  }
  foo = "\nE foo"
;
</pre>

<p>And that we then add the following code to allow us to experiment with 
these classes:

<pre>
testBC: B, C;
testCB: C, B;
testBD: B, D;
testBE: B, E;

DefineIAction(Test)
  execAction()
  {
     "First testBC:\n";
     testBC.hello(); testBC.foo();
     
     "<.p>Then testCB:\n";
     testCB.hello(); testCB.foo();
     
     "<.p>Then testBD:\n";
     testBD.hello(); testBD.foo();
     
     "<.p>And finally testBE:\n";
     testBE.hello(); testBE.foo();
  }
;

VerbRule(Test)
  'test'
  :TestAction
  verbPhrase = 'test/testing'  
;
</pre>

<p>The response to the command TEST will be:

<p>First testBC:<br>
Hello from class A! Hello from class B!<br> 
A foo

<p>Then testCB:<br>
Hello from class A! Hello from class B! Hello from class C!<br>
C foo

<p>Then testBD:<br>
Hello from class A! Hello from class D! Hello from class B!<br> 
D foo

<p>And finally testBE:<br>
Hello from class A! Hello from class B!<br>
A foo  

<p>Let's look at how this output relates to the principles we explored in the 
previous section. We'll start by considering what happens when <b>testBC.foo()</b> is invoked. 
B does not itself define foo(), but it does inherit A.foo(). C defines foo(), but C.foo() 
is not derived from, and hence does not override A.foo(), so it's A.foo() that is invoked 
here. For similar reasons, when inherited is called in B.hello(), it's A.hello() that's 
invoked. C does define a hello() method, but it's not derived from A.hello(), so A.hello() 
can take precedence.

<p>When <b>testCB.foo()</b> is called, we simply get C.foo(), since C defines foo() for 
itself and comes first in the class list, so there's no need to look further for the 
foo method we need. When testCB.hello() is invoked, however, the situation is more 
complicated. Once again this will invoke C.hello(), since C defines its own hello() 
method, but C.hello() contains a call to inherited. Remember, in this situation inherited 
calls what testCB.hello() would call if C didn't provide its own definition of hello(). 
If C.hello() didn't exist, the only version of hello() available to be called on testCB 
is that provided by B, so that's the one that's called. B.hello() also contains a call to
 inherited, which is the method that would have been called if B didn't define hello for 
 itself. In this case, that could only be A.hello(), which B inherits from A. So what we 
 end up with here is A.hello() called from B.hello() called from C.hello().
 
<p>When <b>testBD.foo()</b> is called, B does not define or override A.foo(), but merely 
inherits it. D, on the other hand, does override the foo it would otherwise inherit 
from A. So while B.foo would normally take precedence, since B appears in the class 
list before D, B.foo is simply the inherited A.foo, which is not allowed to take 
precedence over D.foo since D.foo overrides A.foo, so in this case it's D.foo that 
wins out. When testBD.hello() is called, B does supply its own version of B.hello(), 
so that's the one that's used. But B.hello() calls inherited, which is the method that 
would be invoked by testBD.hello() if B.hello() were not defined. Once again the choice 
is between A.hello() inherited by B from A and D.hello() defined on D. Since D inherits 
from A and D.hello() overrides A.hello(), D.hello() cannot be overridden by A.hello(), 
so it's D.hello() that's used. On the other hand, when inherited is encountered in D.hello(), 
it can only refer to A.hello(), with the result that what we end up seeing is A.hello() 
called from D.hello() called from B.hello().

<p>Finally, <b>testBE</b> works the same as testBC, since E derives from C but not A.

<p>It would no doubt be possible to construct far more complex examples than this, 
but these should suffice to illustrate the principle (while more complex examples might 
only confuse). Anyway, the method of analysis employed above rapidly becomes too 
unwieldy to use on more complex cases, so we'll next introduce an algorithm to simplify
it. After discussing this algorithm, we'll move on from these rather abstract 
examples to a pair of concrete involving classes defined in the TADS 3 library; 
<a href='#complex'>the second</a> of these will turn out to be quite complicated enough!

<h2><a name='algorithm'></a>A Simplifying Algorithm</h2>

<p>The kind of reasoning we have just gone through is all very well, but rapidly becomes
more confusing to construct and harder to follow the more complicated the class hierarchy
involved. Moreover, it's not the way the TADS 3 VM actually works. The TADS 3 VM reduces
the problem to a linear ordering of priorities, and so can we. The trick is to find a means
of reducing a set of inheritance relationships into a single list ordered by precedence. 
The algorithm actually employed by the VM is one a human being could follow, but it may
not be the easiest way a human being could do it, so here we'll present a slightly different
procedure for producing the same result.

<p>In essence, it's a matter of following a two-step process:
<ol>
<li>Create a recursively expanded superclass list of the object in question, with the
classes listed in order of inheritance.</li>
<li>Remove all duplicate elements from the list, leaving only their rightmost (i.e. last)
occurrence.</li>
</ol>

<p>Stated thus this procedure is probably less than immediately clear. Two further steps may
aid understanding: (1) a broad description of what it does, and (2) some worked examples 
showing how to carry it out.

<p>What it does is to arrange an object's (or class's) superclass list in order such that:
<ol>
<li>The order of declaration of ancestor classes on the object and it superclasses is
preserved except that</li>
<li>No ancestor class is allowed to take precedence over any of its descendent classes.</li>
</ol>

<p>The first step achieves the first of these goals, while the second step achieves the second. 
The result is equivalant to the definition we gave above, namely "The first (left-most) 
superclass has precedence for inheritance, 
so any properties or methods that it defines effectively override the same properties 
and methods defined in subsequent superclasses, except that an ancestor class does not 
override a method or property on any of its descendent classes."

<p>Now let us unpack the procedure to show how to carry it out. The first step is to
create "a recursively expanded superclass list of the object in question, with the
classes listed in order of inheritance." The simplest way to follow this is probably to
create a sideways superclass tree diagram. To do this, start with the object we're interested
in, list its superclasses below it in a column to the right of it, with each superclass's
superclass listed below and to the right of them, thus:

<pre><font color=blue>
testBC
        B
            A
        C

</font></pre>

<p>(Note that we have excluded the ultimate ancestor <b>object</b> from this procedure, since
normally we'll never need to trace inheritance back that far, and because in any case we
can always be sure that the algorithm will always end up placing <b>object</b> at the very end
of the list).

<p>To complete step 1, we now simply construct a list by reading the above tree diagram from
top to bottom:

<pre><font color=blue>testBC, B, A, C</font></pre>

<p>In this case, there are no duplicates, so there is nothing for Step 2 to do. This tells us 
testBC first inherits foo from B, which, since it neither defines nor overrides it, simply 
inherits it from A. It's therefor A.foo that executes. Similarly testBC.hello() invokes
B.hello(), B being the first class in the list to define hello(), and then that <b>inherited</b>
in B.hello() invokes A.hello(), A being the next class in our list.

<p>Now let's try it with testCB:

<pre><font color=blue>
testCB
       C
       B
           A
</font></pre>

<p>This time, the list we construct by reading from top to bottom is:

<pre><font color=blue>testBC, C, B, A</font></pre>

<p>Again there are no duplicates to delete, so nothing for Step 2 to do. testBC.foo will
invoke C.foo. textBC.hello() will invoke C.hello(), which via <b>inherited</b> invokes
B.hello(), which in turn via <b>inherited</b> invokes A.hello().

<p>Finally, let's try testBD. Here, the superclass tree diagram looks like this:

<pre><font color=blue>
testBD
        B
            A
        D
            A
</font></pre>

<p>So reading down the diagram generates this list:

<pre><font color=blue>testBD, B, A, D, A</font></pre>

<p>This time, A appears twice, so there is something for Step 2 to do. We delete all the
duplicate As (all one of them) leaving only the last:

<pre><font color=blue>testBD, B, D, A</font></pre>

<p>So now, testBD.foo will invoke D.foo, and testBD.hello() invokes B.hello, whose 
<b>inherited</b> invokes D.foo(), whose <b>inherited</b> in turn invokes A.foo().

<p>testBE may be left as an exercise for the reader.


<h2>Some Real Examples</h2>

<h3><a name='conv'></a>(1) A Delayed Conversation Agenda Item</h3>

<p>Suppose we want to combine the functionality of DelayedAgendaItem and ConvAgendaItem, 
that is we want an AgendaItem which is invoked after a certain length of time, but only 
when there's a gap in the conversation and the player character is still present to be 
addressed. We could define:

<pre>
+ delayedConv: DelayedAgendaItem, ConvAgendaItem
  invokeItem()
  {
       "<q>Right!</q> Bob suddenly barks. ";
        isDone = true;
   }
;
</pre>

<p>But will this work as we want it to, or will ConvAgendaItem.isReady be bypassed? 
The question really hinges on what the isReady property of delayedConv will do.

<p>DelayedAgendaItem is defined in the library as:

<pre>
class DelayedAgendaItem: AgendaItem
    isReady = (Schedulable.gameClockTime >= readyTime && inherited())
 
    readyTime = 0
 
    setDelay(turns)
     {    
         readyTime = Schedulable.gameClockTime + turns;
 
         return self;
     }
;
</pre>

<p>While ConvAgendaItem is defined as:

<pre>
class ConvAgendaItem: AgendaItem
     isReady = (!getActor().conversedThisTurn()
                && getActor().canTalkTo(otherActor)
                && inherited()) 
 
     otherActor = (gPlayerChar)
;
</pre>

<p>There's clearly no conflict here between the definitions of readyTime, setDelay() or 
otherActor, the only issue is what delayedConv.isReady will do. Note that on both 
DelayedAgendaItem and ConvAgendaItem isReady invokes the inherited property.

<p>Well, to begin with, delayedConv.isReady must clearly refer in this context to 
DelayedConvAgendaItem.isReady, since DelayedConvAgenda comes first in the class list 
and explicitly defines (or rather, overrides) this property. So the next question is 
what the inherited keyword in the definition of DelayedAgendaItem.isReady will refer 
to in this particular context. The possible candidates are AgendaItem.isReady and 
ConvAgendaItem.isReady. The rule is that the leftmost property takes preference unless
it would involve a base class overriding a property that one of its subclasses overrides.
But ConvAgendaItem does override AgendaItem.isReady, so in this case the inherited within
DelayedAgendaItem.isReady will reference ConvAgendaItem.isReady rather than its base
class's AgendaItem.isReady. ConvAgendaItem.isReady in turn includes the inherited keyword,
but in this case it can only refer to AgendaItem.isReady, since there's nothing else for it
to refer to. So delayedConvAgenda.isReady turns out to be equivalent to:

<pre>
isReady = (Schedulable.gameClockTime >= readyTime 
     && (!getActor().conversedThisTurn()
                && getActor().canTalkTo(otherActor)
                && true ))
</pre>

<p>This is indeed precisely what we'd want from a DelayedConvAgendaItem, so combining 
DelayedAgendaItem and ConvAgendaItem in the superclass list of the same object indeed 
combines the functionality of these two subclasses of AgendaItem, just as we might have hoped.

<p>Again, it would probably be easier to have arrived at this result using the 
<a href='#algorithm'>algorithm</a> (i.e. procedure) described in the previous section.
The relevant superclass tree diagrams are already provided for us in the <i>TADS 3
Library Reference Manual</i>, but we'll reproduce them below:

<pre><font color=blue>
delayedConv
             DelayedAgendaItem
                                 AgendaItem
             ConvAgendaItem
                                 AgendaItem

</font></pre>

<p>Reading from top to bottom, we once again produce our fully expanded superclass list:

<pre><font color=blue>delayedConv, DelayedAgendaItem, AgendaItem, ConvAgendaItem, AgendaItem
</font></pre>

<p>Finally, in Step 2 we delete any duplicates (in this case, the first occurrence of
AgendaItem) leaving only their last instances:

<pre><font color=blue>delayedConv, DelayedAgendaItem, ConvAgendaItem, AgendaItem</font></pre>

This produces the same result we had before, probably more reliably and simply than by trying
to reason our way through the inheritance tree. In such a simple case we could probably 
carry out all the steps in our head, especially once the procedure becomes more familiar.
We'll finish with a rather more complex example, where some resort to pen and paper would
almost certainly be essential.

<h3><a name='complex'></a>(2) Lockable Door</h3>
<p>For our second example we'll pose the question why the first of these two object definitions 
works properly whereas the second does not:

<pre>
(1)
+ myDoor: Lockable, Door 'door' 'door'
;

(2)
+ myDoor: Door, Lockable 'door' 'door'
;
</pre>

<p>The obvious difference you'll soon discover between these two is that whereas with 
(1) the door starts out locked, with (2) it doesn't, however hard you try explicitly 
defining initiallyLocked = true (there may indeed be other problems with (2), but we'll 
focus on this one for now).

<p>In this case the class hierarchy involved is rather more complex than any we've attempted
to deal with so far:

<pre><font color=blue>
                       object
                      /      \
              Linkable       VocabObject
             /   |    \              \
     <u><b>Lockable</b></u>    |     \            Thing
                 |      \          /     \
                 |       \      Travel    NonPortable
                 |        \   Connector    /       
                 |         \      /    Fixture
                 |          \    /    /
                 |           \  /    /
       Basic Openable         Passage                       
       /           \           |
     Openable       \       ThroughPassage
            \        \      / 
             \       BasicDoor
              \     /           
               <u><b>Door</b></u>              
           
                                               
</font></pre>

<p>A look at the library code will reveal that the place where Lockable uses 
initiallyLocked to initialize the locked status of the door is in its initializeThing method:

<pre>
class Lockable: Linkable
    
     initiallyLocked = true
     …
     initializeThing()
     {
         /* inherit the default handling */
         inherited();
         
         /* if we're the master, set our initial state */
         if (masterObject == self)
             isLocked_ = initiallyLocked;
     }
      …
;
</pre>
<p>Linkable also has a definition of initializeThing:

<pre>
Linkable: object
   initializeThing()
   {
         
    inherited();
                    
    if (masterObject != self && masterObject.masterObject == self)
    {             
      masterObject = self;
    }
   }
;
</pre>

<p>Door does not define its own initializeThing method, but could potentially inherit one 
either via BasicDoor from BasicOpenable:

<pre>
BasicOpenable: Linkable
 initializeThing()
     {         
         inherited();
 
         if (masterObject == self)
             isOpen_ = initiallyOpen;
     }
;
</pre>

<p>Or else via BasicDoor from Passage:

<pre>
Passage: Linkable, Fixture, TravelConnector
   initializeThing()
     {
         inherited();
          
         if (masterObject != self)
         {
             otherSide = masterObject;
             masterObject.initMasterObject(self);
         }
     }
;
</pre>

<p>So what happens in this complex case? One way to find out is to set a breakpoint in the 
debugger and try tracing it through. If we start with case (1) and put the breakpoint on 
the first statement (inherited) in Lockable.initializeThing() we find the following. 
The call to inherited in Lockable.initializeThing() invokes BasicOpenable.initializeThing(), 
the first line of which is also an inherited statement. This new inherited statement 
invokes Passage.initializeThing(), the first line of which is yet another inherited statement. 
This third inherited statement invokes Linkable.initializeThing, which yet again starts with 
an inherited statement. This inherited statement finally calls Thing.initializeThing(), which 
at last doesn't contain an inherited statement. Stepping on through the code then takes us to 
the end of Thing.initializeThing() and then back on up the call stack till we eventually 
arrive back at Lockable.initializeThing(). 

<p>This <i>is</i> a complex case, but can we work out what's happening here?

<p>The only realistic way to attempt it is to use the <a href='#algorithm'>algorithm</a>
described above. This is greatly simplified for us by the fact that the <i>Library Reference
Manual</i> already provides us with superclass tree diagrams in the format we need for 
all classes defined in the TADS 3 library, so we can simply look up the relevant classes
in the library and write out our expanded superclass lists by reading down their superclass
tree diagrams.

<p>The list for Lockable is then simply:

<pre><font color=blue>Lockable, Linkable</font></pre>

<p>That for Door is rather longer:

<pre><font color=blue>Door, Openable, BasicOpenable, Linkable, BasicDoor, BasicOpenable,
Linkable, ThroughPassage, Passage, Linkable, Fixture, NonPortable, Thing, 
VocabObject,TravelConnector, Thing, VocabObject</font></pre>

<p>We can now assemble the complete list for myDoor:

<pre><font color=blue>myDoor, Lockable, Linkable, Door, Openable, BasicOpenable, 
Linkable, BasicDoor, BasicOpenable, Linkable, ThroughPassage, 
Passage, Linkable, Fixture, NonPortable, Thing, 
VocabObject,TravelConnector, Thing, VocabObject</font></pre>

<p>The second step is to remove all duplicates, of which there are several, leaving
only the rightmost instance of each class:

<pre><font color=blue>myDoor, Lockable, <s>Linkable</s>, Door, Openable, <s>BasicOpenable</s>, 
<s>Linkable</s>, BasicDoor, BasicOpenable, <s>Linkable</s>, ThroughPassage, 
Passage, Linkable, Fixture, NonPortable, <s>Thing</s>, 
<s>VocabObject</s>,TravelConnector, Thing, VocabObject</font></pre>

<p>So that the list reduces to:

<pre><font color=blue>myDoor, Lockable, Door, Openable, BasicDoor, 
BasicOpenable, ThroughPassage, Passage, Linkable, 
Fixture, NonPortable, TravelConnector, Thing, VocabObject</font></pre>

<p>Finally, to work out what happens when myDoor.initializeThing() is invoked, it
will help to identify which classes in the above list define or override initializeThing(),
and which of the initializeThing() methods include an <b>inherited</b> which will call
the next class's initializeThing() method. Again, this is information that may be gleaned
quite readily from the <i>Library Reference Manual</i>; the easiest way to go about it may 
be to look up initializeThing() in the index of all identifiers.

<p>Here we show the result of doing this by showing all classes in the list that define
or override initializeThing() underlined, and all those whose initializeThing() uses the
<b>inherited</b> keyword in bold:

<pre><font color=blue>myDoor, <u><b>Lockable</b></u>, Door, Openable, BasicDoor, 
<u><b>BasicOpenable</u></b>, ThroughPassage, <u><b>Passage</u></b>, <u><b>Linkable</b></u>, 
Fixture, NonPortable, TravelConnector, <u>Thing</u>, VocabObject</font></pre>

<p>This tells us that myDoor.initializeThing() should invoke Lockable.initializeThing(),
which will invoke BasicOpenable.initializeThing(), which will in turn invoke
Passage.initializeThing(), which will in turn invoke Linkable.initializeThing(),
which will finally invoke Thing.initializeThing(), which is indeed what is shown to 
happen by tracing the calls through the Workbench debugger.

<p>Now let's consider case (2), which had myDoor defined thus:

<pre>
+ myDoor: Door, Lockable 'door' 'door'
;
</pre>

<p>It would be almost impossible to work out in advance what will happen in this case
by some process of abstract reasoning, or trying mentally to predict how execution will
work through the inheritance tree, so instead we need to reduce the classes involved
to a linear list using our algorithm. For step 1, we can simply reassemble the list
we assembled last time in a slightly different order, moving Lockable to a position
after all of Door's superclasses:

<pre><font color=blue>
myDoor, Door, Openable, BasicOpenable, Linkable, 
BasicDoor, BasicOpenable, Linkable, ThroughPassage, Passage, 
Linkable, Fixture, NonPortable, Thing, VocabObject,
TravelConnector, Thing, VocabObject, Lockable, Linkable.
</font></pre>

<p>Then, as before, we carry out the second step of deleting duplicates from the
list, leaving only the rightmost instance of each class (note that this may result
in different instances being deleted than in the previous case):

<pre><font color=blue>
myDoor, Door, Openable, <s>BasicOpenable</s>, <s>Linkable</s>, 
BasicDoor, BasicOpenable, <s>Linkable</s>, ThroughPassage, Passage, 
<s>Linkable</s>, Fixture, NonPortable, <s>Thing</s>, <s>VocabObject</s>,
TravelConnector, Thing, VocabObject, Lockable, Linkable.
</font></pre>

<p>This list then reduces to:

<pre><font color=blue>
myDoor, Door, Openable, BasicDoor, BasicOpenable, 
ThroughPassage, Passage, Fixture, NonPortable, TravelConnector, 
Thing, VocabObject, Lockable, Linkable.
</font></pre>

<p>This now gives the order of inheritance. Once again to work out what happens when
myDoor.initializeThing() is invoked it will be helpful to identify those classes in the
list that define or override initializeThing(). Once again, those that define (or override)
this method are shown underlined, while those whose initializeThing() method include
<b>inherited</b> are shown in bold:

<pre><font color=blue>
myDoor, Door, Openable, BasicDoor, <u><b>BasicOpenable</b></u>, 
ThroughPassage, <u><b>Passage</b></u>, Fixture, NonPortable, TravelConnector, 
<u>Thing</u>, VocabObject, <u><b>Lockable</b></u>, <u><b>Linkable</b></u>.
</font></pre>

This tells us that myDoor.initializeThing() will first call BasicOpenable.initializeThing(), 
since BasicOpenable is the first (leftmost) class that defines (or overrides) an 
initializeThing() method. To find out what the <b>inherited</b> in 
BasicOpenable.initializeThing() calls, find the next class in the list that defines 
(or overrides) initializeThing(). This turns out to be Passage. Passage.initializeThing() 
again includes a call to <b>inherited</b>, so to find out what <i>that</i> invokes, 
find the next class in the list that defines initializeThing(), which turns out to be Thing. 
This is where the trail ends, since when Thing.initializeThing() is invoked, it 
does <i>not</i> contain any call to <b>inherited</b>. 

<p>This outcome may well strike you as rather counter-intuitive; it would not be at all 
easy to predict in advance of trying it (or without going through the type of exercise
we've just gone through) which classes' initializeThing() methods would end 
up being invoked here, but you can verify that this is in fact what does happen by stepping 
it through the Workbench debugger. The upshot is that by placing Lockable in the superclass 
list after Door, not only do we prevent Lockable from initializing myDoor.isLocked_ properly, 
we also prevent it from initializing myDoor.masterObject properly, which is what 
Linkable.initializeThing() would have done had it not be blocked by the misplacement of 
Lockable in myDoor's superclass list. This illustrates why mix-in classes that don't inherit
from Thing should be placed before Thing-derived classes in a superclass list. If the overall
object is Thing-derived it's usually desirable, if not essential, that the order of precedence
of its base classes should end with Thing, VocabObject. This will only happen if all non-Thing
derived classes are placed <i>before</i> the Thing-derived ones.


<p>This is admittedly a highly complex example, so don't worry if you don't feel you entirely 
understand it, especially first time round. You'll seldom need to have to work out something 
this convoluted for yourself when dealing with multiple inheritance; for the most part you can 
simply rely on the library to do its job. When you modify or define your own classes, or use 
<b>inherited</b> on objects you define, you're most unlikely to need to reckon with anything 
half so complicated as this, provided that you make sure always to list library classes in 
the right order from the outset, which generally means placing non-Thing derived mix-in 
classes before Thing-derived classes when they appear in the same superclass list. 
It is, however, no bad thing to be aware of some of the underlying complexities here, 
in case you do encounter a situation where things are not working as you expected them to and 
you need to work out why. 

<p>If this isn't all entirely clear yet, you might like to check out the article on the
<a href="../sysman/inherit.htm">Object Inheritance Model</a> in the <i>System Manual</i>,
which takes a complementary approach to explaining it all.
