<h1>Programming Conversations with NPCs</h1>
<h2>(Adapted for Adv3Lite by Eric Eve)</h2>
<p>Editor's Note. While much of the material in this article is also covered 
in the <a href='../manual/actor.htm'>Actors</a> section of the <i>Adv3Lite Library Manual</i>, Mike Roberts's 
discussion below provides more detailed discussion of the rationale of his design and some more extensive
explanations that seem worth preserving in the adv3Lite version of this manual. Moreover,
since the adv3Lite handling of conversation was based on the way 
it is implemented in adv3, much of MJR's discussion here applies unchanged to adv3Lite.
In what follows, I have adapted MJR's text where things are done differently in adv3Lite,
and referred the reader to the  <i>Adv3Lite Library Manual</i> for additions that adv3Lite
makes to the system that MJR devised.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>In the <a href='convbkg.htm'>previous part of this article</a>, I (MJR)
offered my recommendations for a conversation system based on the
traditional ASK/TELL model, but with some enhancements.  The TADS 3
library provides support for a lot of the effects I described in my
recommendations.

<p>The library doesn't lock you into using any particular conversation
style; I think it would be relatively easy to implement any of the
systems mentioned in my <a href='convbkg.htm#survey'>survey</a>.  Many
of the library classes for conversation support could be repurposed
for other types of conversations, and if all else fails you can always
ignore this part of the library and build your own completely custom
conversation system.  But if you do choose to use my proposed system,
the library offers ready-made support for many elements of it.


<h2 id="asktell">Basic ASK/TELL</h2>

<p>The traditional IF conversation system uses individual ASK/TELL
commands, where each ASK ABOUT or TELL ABOUT is answered with a pat
response.  For minor NPCs who don't have a significant role in the
story, this is usually all you want.  The library makes it easy to set
this up.

<p>The key to implementing ASK/TELL responses is the TopicEntry
object.  This is an "abstract" object that doesn't have any existence
in the game world - it's not something that shows up in room listings
or that characters can pick up and manipulate.  Each TopicEntry
object defines a three-way association: a question, an answer, and
the actor who's being asked.  The question is represented as the
indirect object of an ASK ABOUT command; this can be a physical object
in the game (a Thing object, for example), an abstract Topic object,
or simply a regular expression pattern, if you want to match some
specific text string.  The answer is usually simply a string to display,
but more advanced responses are possible, as we'll see a little later.
The actor who's being asked is simply the Actor object to whom the
question can be directed.

<p>Each TopicEntry further defines what kind of command it responds
to.  There are four pre-defined commands that TopicEntry objects can
answer: ASK, TELL, SHOW, and GIVE.  You can always add your own
additional types if you need to, but these are the ones used in the
traditional conversation model (and my recommended style).

<p>This might sound like a lot of work just to define a single answer
to a single question, but the way the library sets it up, it's really
very convenient - more convenient than adding an element to a
switch() statement, which is what TADS 2 authors usually end up doing.
The library provide "templates" customized for TopicEntry objects, and
it requires relatively little typing to add one of these.  In addition,
you can usually specify the type of command the TopicEntry answers by
using one of the several pre-defined subclasses of TopicEntry: 

<ul>
  <li>AskTopic answers an ASK ABOUT question;
  <li>TellTopic responds to a TELL ABOUT command;
  <li>AskTellTopic answers either an ASK ABOUT or TELL ABOUT command;
  <li>AskForTopic responds to an ASK FOR request.
  <li>GiveTopic responds to a GIVE TO command;
  <li>ShowTopic responds to a SHOW TO command;
  <li>GiveShowTopic responds to either a GIVE TO or SHOW TO command;
  <li>YesTopic responds to a YES command;
  <li>NoTopic responds to a NO command.
</ul>

<p>The most common type of topic entry in most games will probably be
the AskTellTopic, since you usually want to treat ASK and TELL as
equivalent for a given topic.  Likewise, in most situations, games
tend to treat GIVE and SHOW as interchangeable.  It's always up to
you to decide how you'll treat each command, though.  If you want to
treat ASK and TELL differently for the same topic, you would simply
create an AskTopic to handle the ASK response, and a separate TellTopic
to handle the TELL response.  When you want to treat ASK and TELL as
equivalent for a topic, you need only create a single AskTellTopic
object to handle both commands.

<p>The association of a TopicEntry with the target actor is created using
the familiar "location" property.  This means you can use the "+" syntax
to put the TopicEntry "inside" the answering actor.

<p>Here's an example of how we could define an actor and a few 
responses.

<p><pre>
  bob: Actor 'Bob;;;him'
    "He's a nervous-looking older man with white hair. "   
  ;

  + AskTellTopic @antenna
    "&lt;q&gt;Have you been to the antenna?&lt;/q&gt; you ask.
    &lt;.p&gt;&lt;q&gt;I climbed it once,&lt;/q&gt; Bob says. &lt;q&gt;It's pretty scary
    up there. Great view of the city, though.&lt;/q&gt; "
  ;

  + TellTopic @lighthouse
    "&lt;q&gt;I was in the lighthouse earlier today,&lt;/q&gt; you start.
    &lt;.p&gt;Bob becomes quite flustered. &lt;q&gt;What are you talking about?
    That thing was torn down years ago, after the...\ troubles.&lt;/q&gt; "
  ;
</pre>

<p>Note the format for defining each topic entry: we use a "+" to put
the topic "inside" the actor, and we use an "at" sign, "@", to
indicate the topic we want to respond to.  The topics we've listed
here - antenna, lighthouse - refer to objects in the game; the
examples here are probably Fixture objects, or something like that.

<p>Note that conversational commands are allowed to refer to objects
that aren't physically present, because the "scope" of conversational
topics extends to anything in the game that the player character has
ever seen or otherwise knows about.  In some ways, this simplifies
things, because you don't have to worry about defining the vocabulary
words for a topic entry - you just point the topic entry to the game
object that you want to talk about, and the parser matches that
object's vocabulary as usual.  In other ways, this complicates things
a bit; in particular, if there are several objects in the game that
all go by the name of "lighthouse," then that topic phrase will match
all of those objects.  Fortunately, you mostly won't have to
worry about this, because of the way TopicEntry matches its topic:
the parser first picks the list of objects that match the player's
topic phrase, then matches these against the TopicEntry "@" object.
If the "@" object is found among the topic phrase matches, then
the TopicEntry is considered a match.

<p>Sometimes, you'll want to define a single topic entry that matches
multiple game objects.  To do this, simply provide a list of objects
in place of the "@" object - and omit the "@" in this case.  Here's
an example:

<p><pre>
  + AskTellTopic [harbor, island, shore]
    "&lt;q&gt;Do you know how to get onto the island in the
    harbor?&lt;/q&gt;
    &lt;.p&gt;He ponders for a moment.  &lt;q&gt;Well,&lt;/q&gt; he says
    slowly, &lt;q&gt;I've heard that crazy old fisherman talk
    about a hidden dock on the north side.&lt;/q&gt; "
  ;
</pre>

<p>If there's no "physical" object in the game that corresponds to a
conversation topic, you can always add a Topic object.  A Topic is an
abstract object (not part of the game world) whose only real purpose
is to match noun phrases for commands like ASK and TELL.  You define
one of these the same way you would any ordinary Thing, but the only
property that a Topic usually needs is its vocabulary - there's rarely
any need to give a Topic a location, a description, or any other
properties.

<p><pre>
  meaningOfLifeTopic: Topic 'meaning of life';
</pre>

<p>(Note that you'll almost always want to name each Topic object you
create, rather than creating them anonymously.  In most cases, the
whole reason to create a Topic object is so that you can refer to it
with an AskTellTopic (or other topic entry type), and to do that, you
need to give the Topic a name.  In the example above, we've named our
Topic object "meaningOfLifeTopic", which lets us refer to it with the
normal "@" syntax when defining a topic entry.)

<p>You can also match a regular expression pattern in a TopicEntry,
instead of a game object.  It's usually a lot easier to match physical
game objects or Topic objects, since you get the full power of the
parser to interpret all of the different possible phrasings (such as
using "the", or arranging adjectives in different orders, or
abbreviating long words).  Once in a while, though, you might
encounter a situation where you want to match an unusual phrasing that
doesn't fit into the parser's normal ideas what a noun phrase looks
like; in these cases, it's sometimes easier to just use a regular
expression and match the literal text.  Simply use a single-quoted
string in place of the "@" object in the TopicEntry definition (and,
as with an object list, leave out the "@").

<p><pre>
  + TopicEntry '&lt;alpha&gt;&lt;digit&gt;{3}'
    "&lt;q&gt;Does the sequence &lt;q&gt;&lt;&lt;gTopic.getTopicText()&gt;&gt;&lt;/q&gt;
    mean anything to you?&lt;/q&gt;
    &lt;.p&gt;&lt;q&gt;That sounds like a keypad code down at the
    ferry terminal.&lt;/q&gt; "
  ;
</pre>

<p>As you can see, TopicEntry objects make it easy and convenient to
add responses to a character's repertoire.  The nice thing about them
is that they don't require any coding - you essentially just create an
"inventory" of things a character knows about.

<h2 id='sequential'>Sequential and random responses</h2>

<p>With the basic TopicEntry definitions we've seen so far, a
character will respond the same way to a topic no matter how many
times the same question is asked.  Every so often, though, it's
useful to make a character reveal more information about a topic if
asked repeatedly.  The TopicEntry object makes this easy by allowing
you to combine a TopicEntry and an EventList into a single object.  

<p>To use an EventList in a topic entry, choose a subclass of EventList,
and add this class to the superclass list when defining the
TopicEntry.  Then, provide a list of single-quoted strings for the
response instead of the one response string.  For situations where
you want a character to reveal more information when pressed, the
best choice is StopEventList: when the last element of this kind of
list is reached, the list will simply stop at the last element and
repeat it indefinitely.  Here's an example:

<p><pre>
  + AskTellTopic, StopEventList @lighthouse
    ['&lt;q&gt;I was in the lighthouse earlier today,&lt;/q&gt; you start.
    &lt;.p&gt;Bob becomes quite flustered. &lt;q&gt;What are you talking about?
    That thing was torn down years ago, after the... troubles.&lt;/q&gt; ',

    '&lt;q&gt;What did you mean about the lighthouse being torn down?&lt;/q&gt;
    &lt;.p&gt;&lt;q&gt;Just what I said,&lt;/q&gt; he says. &lt;q&gt;It hasn't been there
    for years. No way you could have been in it.&lt;/q&gt; ',

    '&lt;q&gt;When was the lighthouse torn down?&lt;/q&gt;
    &lt;.p&gt;&lt;q&gt;Like I said, after those troubles we had.&lt;/q&gt; ']
  ;
</pre>

<p>You can use the same approach to achieve other effects.  A common
variation is using random responses rather than sequential responses.
For random responses, you would create a TopicEntry like the example
above, but you'd use RandomEventList or ShuffledEventList instead of
StopEventList.  (I'd personally recommend ShuffledEventList over
RandomEventList in most cases.  RandomEventList just picks a response
at random and shows it; it's like rolling dice to pick a response.
ShuffledEventList instead first arranges the whole list of responses
into a random order, then takes responses from the shuffled list one
at a time, like dealing from a shuffled deck of cards.  When the list
runs out, ShuffledEventList re-shuffles the list and starts over.
Psychologically, this looks a lot more random to players, because it
minimizes repetition by going through the whole list before repeating
anything.)

<h2 id='default'>Default responses</h2>

<p>As I talked about in the
<a href='convbkg.htm#recommendations'>Recommendations</a> 
section, it's important
to provide a good set of customized "default responses" for each
character, to handle the times when the player asks about something
that you haven't anticipated.  The topic entry system makes this easy.

<p>You define a default response (or a set of default responses) just
like any other topic entry, but you use one of the DefaultTopic
classes - DefaultAskTopic, DefaultTellTopic, DefaultAskTellTopic,
DefaultAskForTopic, DefaultGiveTopic, DefaultShowTopic, or
DefaultGiveShowTopic.  There's also the special DefaultAnyTopic, which
is a catch-all that will respond to any of the other types of topics.
For many NPCs, you'll be able to define one DefaultAnyTopic;
sometimes, though, you'll want to differentiate the default responses
to different types of commands, so you might define one
DefaultAskTellTopic and one DefaultGiveShowTopic, for example.  You
can use ShuffledEventList, as described above, to randomly show a
different message each time one is needed.

<p>In addition to catch-all defaults for completely unknown topics,
you can also define fallbacks for groups of topics where one particular
thing has a more specific message.  The way to do this is to use
the "matchScore" property of a topic entry.  

<p>When the actor is choosing which topic entry to use, it scans its
database to find all of the topic entries that match what the user
typed in, and it notes each matching entry's matchScore.  If there's
more than one matching entry, the actor chooses the one with the
highest score.  The matchScore is just an integer value; if you don't
specify a matchScore for a TopicEntry object, the default is 100.  Any
numeric score indicates a match; a score of nil means that there's no
match at all.

<p>(The score is how DefaultTopic and its subclasses work, by the
way.  DefaultTopic will match anything at all, but it matches with
the lowest possible matching score value, 1.  So, a DefaultTopic
will always match everything the player types in, but it will only
be selected if there's not another TopicEntry that also matches,
because any other TopicEntry will have a higher score.)

<p>To assign a score to a TopicEntry object, put a "+" sign and the
score value immediately following the class name:

<p><pre>
  + AskTellTopic +80 @lighthouse // etc
</pre>

<h2>Conditional responses</h2>

<p>Topics and their responses aren't always constant throughout a
game.  The kinds of questions the player character can ask can change
as events unfold, and NPCs can learn things as well.  For example,
it makes no sense for the player character to ask anyone about an
event until after it happens; similarly, an NPC's response to a
question might change after the NPC witnesses some event.

<p>To handle this kind of change, topic entries can be made
conditional.  A topic entry is made conditional by defining an
"isActive" property in the TopicEntry object; the topic entry will be
used only if isActive returns true.

<p>For example, suppose we wanted to create a response to a question
about an event that happens midway through the game.  We obviously
don't want to use the response before the event happens, so we could
make it conditional on a property value that we set when the event
occurs:

<p><pre>
  + AskTellTopic @lighthouse
    "&lt;q&gt;What do you know about the fire at the lighthouse?&lt;/q&gt;
    [etc.] "

    isActive = (lighthouse.fireStarted)
  ;
</pre>

<p>This topic will be completely ignored until the fireStarted
property of the lighthouse has been set to true; we'll presumably set
this property in some other part of the game at the proper time.  If
the player asks about the lighthouse before that, the topic will act
as though it doesn't even exist, so the actor will fall back on its
default response.  Once the lighthouse fire has started, the topic
will pop into existence.  The nice thing about this approach is that
it keeps the code for the condition test right with the topic itself
- you don't have to worry about inserting any handling for the topic
itself in the part of the game that handles the lighthouse fire, and
you don't have to hunt around the game's source code to figure out
where the topic is activated.

<p>Sometimes, merely becoming active after an event isn't good enough;
sometimes you want a topic's response to change according to an event.
There are a couple of ways to handle this.  The simplest is to use
"alternative" topic objects, which are defined with the class AltTopic.
Alternative topics let you create essentially an if-then-else list
for a given topic, but without writing any procedural code.

<p>Defining an AltTopic is simple: you just nest it within the
TopicEntry object that you want the AltTopic to "override" when it's
active.  The AltTopic always takes its match conditions from its
parent, so you don't even have to repeat the match object, or say what
kind of command (ASK, TELL, GIVE, SHOW) it matches.  The only thing
you usually have to define with an AltTopic object is the response and
the isActive condition.

<p><pre>
  + AskTellTopic @lighthouse
    "(This is the 'default' response to ASK/TELL ABOUT 
    LIGHTHOUSE - this one will be used when the nested
    AltTopic isn't active.)"
  ;

  ++ AltTopic
    "(This is the 'overriding' response.  It matches
    exactly the same commands as the parent, so it'll
    respond to ASK/TELL ABOUT LIGHTHOUSE.  This one
    will override the parent when isActive is true.)"

    isActive = (lighthouse.fireStarted)
  ;
</pre>

<p>You can add any number of AltTopic objects nested within a regular
topic entry.  To add a third possibility to the example above, we'd
just add another AltTopic (also with two '+' signs) after the one we
just defined, and so on to any number of additional alternatives.

<p>The order of the AltTopics is important: it goes from most general
to most specific.  The actor will always choose the <b>last</b> active
topic in a group of alternatives, because it's the most specific one.
Each subsequent AltTopic is more specific than the previous one, so an
AltTopic overrides all of the previous ones when it's active.

<p>Alternative topics are one way to create responses that change
as the game unfolds.  Alternative topics are convenient to use, but
they're not very flexible.  When AltTopics won't do the trick, you
can use the matchScore mechanism as a more general approach.  Recall
that the active topic with the best matchScore is the one that's
chosen when more than one match is found.  You can take advantage of
this to define your own hierarchy of matches.  For example, we could
rewrite the example above like so:

<p><pre>
  + AskTellTopic @lighthouse 
    "This is the general case..."
  ;

  + AskTellTopic +110 @lighthouse
    "This is the more specific case..."

    isActive = (lighthouse.fireStarted)
  ;
</pre>

<p>The actor will choose the second one over the first whenever the
second one's isActive property returns true, because the second has a
higher score.  For this particular case, the AltTopic approach is
better, because it makes the relationship between the two topics more
apparent just looking at the source code.  However, the score
approach lets you do things you couldn't do with AltTopics, such as
use slightly different match criteria for the two; for example, you
could set up the second topic to match several objects, such as
[lighthouse, reflector, island], rather than just the lighthouse.

<h3>Why not just use 'if'?</h3>

<p>You might look at the AltTopic and "score" examples and wonder why
you shouldn't do this with a somewhat more straightforward if-then-else
test:

<p><pre>
  + AskTellTopic @lighthouse
    topicResponse()
    {
      if (lighthouse.fireStarted)
        "This is the post-fire case. ";
      else
        "This is the general case. ";
    }
  ;
</pre>

<p>This example does exactly what it looks like it will, so clearly
you <i>can</i> use the topic system and still use if-then-else
conditions for the responses, if you want.  In simple cases this can
be fine, but it has a couple disadvantages.  First, as the game
expands, that if-then-else test is likely to expand into more
branches, and you'll get the kind of spaghetti that the topic database
system was designed to avoid.  Second, and perhaps more importantly,
when you use an AltTopic or a separate, conditional topic entry, each
of the topic entries is a separate object with its own properties.
This means, for example, that the topic inventory system (which we'll
see in a moment) can treat the different conditional topics
separately: it can suggest a topic only when the conditions are right,
and it can re-suggest a topic when the conditions change.

<h3>Player character knowledge and NPC knowledge</h3>

<p>The library keeps track of what the player character knows, via the
Actor method knowsAbout(obj), but it doesn't use any sort of NPC
"knowledge model" in the conversation system.  Instead, the
conversation system leaves it up to the game to determine what things
an NPC can say.

<h4>Actor.knowsAbout: PC knowledge</h4>

<p>The library has a specific mechanism for tracking PC knowledge.
Actor has a method, knowsAbout(obj), which indicates whether or not
the given actor knows about the object.

<p>Note that, by default, the library tracks only the player
character's knowledge.  Most games don't need to track NPC knowledge
separately, so the library doesn't bother keeping separate NPC
knowledge bases, to reduce overhead.  If you want to track an NPC's
knowledge separately, you can do so easily: you merely have to set the
NPC's knownProp and/or seenProp properties to new values unique to
that actor.  The Actor class in the adv3Lite library describes this in
more detail.

<p>The knowsAbout() method uses an internal flag (familiar) tracking whether the
player character knows about the object.  An object is considered
"known" to an actor if the actor has ever seen the object, or the
object's "known" status has been specifically set.  The "known" status
can be used to indicate that the player character knows about things
that have never been seen; this can be useful for objects that ought
to be known to the player character because they're part of the
character's background knowledge, or because the character hears about
them in conversation, for example.  You can set the "known" status
using actor.setKnowsAbout(obj).

<h4>TopicEntry.isActive: NPC knowledge, and more</h4>

<p>Each TopicEntry has a property, isActive, that indicates whether
or not the entry is "active."  If an entry is active, then the entry
can be used in a response; otherwise it can't.  It's up to your game
to determine how you want to define and use this status information.

<p>One way of using the active status is as a model of NPC knowledge.
When an NPC is meant to know a response, you can mark the NPC's
TopicEntry object for that response as active.  At other times, you
can make the entry inactive.  This ensures that the NPC can only
respond to a question about the topic when the NPC knows the answer.
To distinguish PC knowledge from NPC knowledge it's a good idea to test
pcKnows(<i>something</i>, where <i>something</i> can be an object,
Topic or 'informed' tag. For details of how PC knowledge and 
NPC knowledge can be tracked in the adv3Lite library, see the chapter
on <a href='../manual/knowledge.htm'>Player Character and NPC Knowledge</a> 
in the <i>Adv3LiteLibrary Reference Manual</i>.

<p>It's important to note that (if you only use reveal tags for tracking
both PC and NPC knowledge) you're modeling the NPC's knowledge of
the <i>response</i>, not of the topic.  You could have several
TopicEntry for the same NPC that respond to the same topic, but the
NPC "knows" each of the responses at different times.  This lets you
vary an NPC's answers to questions about a topic as the NPC's
knowledge changes.

<p>Even though you can use isActive to represent NPC knowledge,
in practice it's useful to use it for other purposes as well. 
<ul>

<li>You can use isActive to model the NPC's frame of mind or emotional
state, separately from its knowledge.  For example, you could have
the NPC use one response (i.e., one TopicEntry) for a given topic when
the NPC is angry, and another when the NPC is contented. For one way of 
keeping track of the NPC's emotional state, see the chapter on 
<a href='../manual/mood.htm'>Moods and Stances</a> in the <i>Adv3LiteLibrary Reference Manual</i>.

<li>You can use isActive to model what the NPC thinks the player
knows, or what the NPC wants to reveal at the moment.  For example,
you could have the NPC try to conceal something, by giving an
uninformative (or misleading) response to a question on a topic.  But
later on, after the player has confronted the NPC with an accusation,
say, or bribed the NPC, the NPC could start being more cooperative,
giving more informative answers to the same topic.  Note that we're
not modeling the NPC's knowledge here, because the NPC knows the more
informative response all along; we're instead modeling the NPC's
desire to keep the information secret.

<li>You can use isActive to model what the player character knows.
Sometimes, the simple knowledge model for the player character,
contained in the knowsAbout() system, isn't adequate to represent
nuances of PC knowledge.  It's often the case that the whole meaning
of a question can change as the PC learns things.  For example, the PC
might know about another character named Mary throughout the game, but
the meaning of ASK BOB ABOUT MARY could change as the game progresses:

<p><pre>
  + AskTellTopic @mary
    "&lt;q&gt;What can you tell me about Mary?&lt;/q&gt;
    [...] "
  ;

  ++ AltTopic
    "&lt;q&gt;Mary told me all about how you cheated on her,&lt;/q&gt; you say,
    unable to disguise your contempt.
    [...] "

    isActive = (gRevealed('bob\'s affair'))
  ;
</pre>

<p>We'll see more on gRevealed later - it's a simple mechanism that
lets you keep track of arbitrary bits of player character knowledge
using a global table keyed by string names.  What we've done here is
made the meaning of ASK BOB ABOUT MARY conditional on whether we've
revealed Bob's affair yet; if not, the player character wouldn't know
to ask about the affair, so a question about Mary is just a question
about Mary.  Once the affair has been revealed, though, ASK BOB ABOUT
MARY takes on a different meaning.

</ul>

<h4>Selecting a response: PC knowledge + topic entry activation</h4>

<p>The parser uses knowsAbout() to select which objects the player is
referring to with a command involving a topic, such as ASK or TELL.
The parser first finds all of the objects (Things and Topics) that
match the noun phrase the player typed, then it narrows the list down
to those objects that return true from knowsAbout().  This is the list
that the parser matches against the various TopicEntry objects
associated with the NPC being questioned.

<p>Taken together, these two mechanisms - the TopicEntry's isActive
property, and the Actor.knowsAbout() method - ensure that we consider
the player character's knowledge as well as the game-defined factors
that go into determining whether or not a response is active.  We
first figure out what the player could possibly be asking about by
using player character knowledge; once we've narrowed down the list,
we find the appropriate response using the isActive status of the
topic entries.

<h2>Groups of conditional responses</h2>

<p>Sometimes, a whole group of responses will share a single
condition.  For example, you might want to create a character who has
a number of emotional conditions - he might be happy, sad, or angry.
For each emotion, you might have a set of specialized responses that
only apply in that mood.  It would be a little tedious to have to
type the same "bob.emotion == sad" condition over and over for all
of the different responses.  The library has a class that helps with
this sort of thing: TopicGroup.

<p>A TopicGroup is an abstract "container" for topics.  You can put
topic entries inside a TopicGroup just like you can put them inside an
actor.  The TopicGroup itself goes inside an actor, and any topic entries
within a topic group act as though they were defined directly in the
actor.  However, the TopicGroup has the additional feature that you
can define an isActive condition on the TopicGroup object, and the
condition will automatically apply to everything in the group.

<p><pre>
  bob: Actor /* ... */ ;

  + TopicGroup isActive = (bob.emotion == sad); // or,if using Moods, (aMoodIs(bob, sad))
  ++ AskTellTopic @bob "&lt;q&gt;I'm so depressed...&lt;/q&gt; ";
  ++ AskTellTopic @store "&lt;q&gt;Sales have been terrible.&lt;/q&gt; ";

  + TopicGroup isActive = (bob.emotion == happy); // or. if using Moods, (aMoodIs(bob, happy))
  ++ AskTellTopic @bob "&lt;q&gt;I feel great!&lt;/q&gt; ";
  ++ AskTellTopic @store "&lt;q&gt;Things have been going well.&lt;/q&gt; ";
</pre>

<p>The isActive condition of a TopicGroup is cumulative: in order to be
active, a TopicEntry object must return true from its own isActive
property, and its group must <i>also</i> return true.  In other words,
the isActive condition of a topic entry is AND'ed with the isActive
condition of its group.

<p>You can nest TopicGroups within TopicGroups.  When you do this,
all of the enclosing group conditions are AND'ed together.


<h2>State-specific responses</h2>

<p>In many cases, the "isActive" condition of a given response will
simply depend on the actor's state.  If we go back to the "hair on
fire" example in the <a href='t3actor.htm'>first part</a> of this
article, we'd want the man to respond to the BACCARAT topic (and,
in fact, most topics) differently in the hair-on-fire state than
in the sitting-at-table state.

<p>It's especially easy to specify that a topic entry is valid only
in a given state: just put the topic entry "inside" the state object.
Just as you can put topic entries inside an actor to associate them
with the actor, you can put topic entries inside an actor state to
associate them with the state.

<p><pre>
  baccaratMan: Actor
    // ...
  ;

  + AskTellTopic @baccarat
    "<q>Baccarat is like life: it's all about risk.</q> "
  ;

  + DefaultAskTellTopic
    "He suavely ignores you and takes a sip of his drink. "
  ;

  + sittingState: ActorState
    // ...
  ;

  + hairOnFireState: ActorState
    // ...
  ;

  ++ AskTellTopic @baccart
    "<q>Baccarat is like - Ack! Help! I'm on fire! </q> "
  ;

  ++ DefaultAskTellTopic
    "<q>Ack! Stop asking me questions and find me some water!</q> "
  ;
</pre>

<p>The topic entries for the current state "override" the entries for
the actor itself.  When you ask about a topic, the actor will first
look for a matching topic among the ones defined as "inside" its
current state; if it can find one, that's the one we use.  If there's
no match in the current state, then the actor looks for a match among
the topics defined directly inside the actor.

<p>Note that the score is important for resolving multiple matches at
each level, but the score isn't important in deciding whether to use
the topics defined in the actor state or those defined directly in the
actor.  If there's <i>any</i> match in the actor state, we'll use that
match, completely ignoring any other matches in the actor itself.
This means that if you define a DefaultAskTellTopic inside the state
object, then it will completely override every response defined in the
actor.  So, in the example above, when we're in the "hair on fire"
state, we'll never see a response defined directly in the actor,
because the "find me some water" default response in the state object
overrides every response directly in the actor.


<h2 id="suggest">Topic inventory</h2>

<p>If you don't like the "topic inventory" idea I described in the
<a href='convbkg.htm#recommendations'>Recommendations</a> section, you can
skip this part.  Briefly, the idea is to mark selected topics as
suggestions, and display a list of the currently open suggestions
to the player at certain times, such as when the player enters a
TOPICS command to specifically ask for the list.

<p>To create a suggestion, you first have to define a "name" property for the suggestion.
This is the name that will be shown in the suggested topic list.
There's also a "fullName" property, but for the pre-defined  The
"name" property should be given so that it can be substituted into a
sentence after "ask about" (or the appropriate variation for the other
types), so it should usually include "the" if appropriate. Alternatively 
you can define autoName = true on the TopicEntry and it will set its 
neme property to the theName property of the object it matches.

<p><pre>
  + AskTellTopic @lighthouse
    "&lt;q&gt;Can you tell me about the lighthouse?&lt;/q&gt; [etc.] "

    name = 'the lighthouse'
  ;
</pre>

<p>Second, you'll need to make sure the suggestion won't show up "too
early" or "too late". The library shows a suggestion according to whether:

<ol>
<li>the associatedTopicEntry defines a name property;</li>

<li>the associated TopicEntry is active - that is, its isActive property
returns true;

<li>if the associated TopicEntry has a match object or a list of match
objects in its matchObj property, then at least one of the match
objects must be known to the player character (so
gPlayerChar.knowsAbout(obj) must return true for at least one of the
match objects);


<li>the player character must not already have "satisfied their curiosity"
about the suggestion, which usually just means that the associated topic
entry has displayed its response already.

<li>the player character's curiosity about this suggestio has been aroused
(by default we assume it has);</li>

<li>The Topic Entry is reachable (i.e. it could potentially be triggered
 by a player command on the current turn).</li>

</ol>

<p>These conditions usually ensure that a suggestion won't be shown
until the player character knows about whatever it is we're suggesting
that they ask about, and that it won't be shown again once the player
acts on the suggestion.  The nice thing about this set of conditions
is that they generally figure out when to show a suggestion based on
information you've already defined for the topic entry itself, because
in most cases you simply want a topic to be suggested if and only if
the topic can be used as a response.

<p>In some cases, you might have to override curiosityAroused or 
curiositySatisfied to have the topic suggestion appear and disappear
when you deem it appropriate.

<p>For the full story on suggesting topics (which can be customized 
further than is outlined here), see the chapter on <a href='../manual/suggest.htm'>
Suggesting Conversational Topics</a> in <i>Adv3LiteLibrary Reference Manual</i>.

<h3><a name='activeTopicInventory'>The active topic inventory</a></h3>

<p>The list of active topic inventory topics is constructed from a
hierarchy of sources for the NPC we're talking to:

<p><ul>
<li>the NPC's current ConvNode
<li>the NPC's current ActorState
<li>the Actor object representing the NPC
</ul>

<p>In some cases, a ConvNode won't allow the player to stray from the
current topic (see "<a href='#exclusiveConvNodes'>ConvNodes with
exclusive responses</a>" below).  For example, a ConvNode might insist
on a YES or NO answer to a question.  In cases where it's obvious from
context that only certain limited topics are meaningful, it's
pointless to suggest other topics, since the other topics won't be
accepted.  For these cases, you can set the ConvNode's
limitSuggestions property to true, indicating that only the ConvNode's
topics should be included in the topic inventory.

<p>Similarly, the ActorState sometimes limits the range of accepted
topics.  To handle these cases, you can set limitSuggestions to true
on the ActorState, indicating that the suggestion list should stop at
the ActorState.  Note that this doesn't omit the ConvNode suggestions,
because the ActorState is below the ConvNode in the hierarchy we
mentioned above.  The limitSuggestions property merely cuts off the
list <i>below</i> the current point in the hierarchy.  So,
limitSuggestions on a ConvNode cuts off everything below the ConvNode,
and limitSuggestions on an ActorState cuts off everything below the
ActorState.

<p>It's up to you to determine how you use limitSuggestions.  You
could, for example, adopt a policy that any ConvNode or ActorState
with a DefaultAnyTopic should limit suggestions to that level, because
the DefaultAnyTopic will prevent responses to topics below that level.
The library doesn't use this policy automatically, though, because the
suggestion list is meant to be a list of things the <i>player
character</i> wants to talk about, not things the NPC will respond to.
In some cases, the PC might want to talk about something even at times
when the NPC won't actually respond to the topic.  At other times, it
ought to be obvious to the player character that only a YES or NO
answer (for example) is appropriate.  That's why the library leaves it
up to you to decide how to limit suggestions.  As you design your
game, you can use limitSuggestions to fine-tune the topic inventory at
times that it's obvious that the conversational options are limited.

<h3>Satisfying curiosity</h3>

<p>Each time a topic entry is used to respond to a command, the topic
entry records the use by incrementing an internal counter, stored in a
property of the topic entry called "talkCount".  By default, the
TopicSuggestion object looks at this property, and automatically
deactivates the suggestion as soon as the counter is at or above the
value of the property "timesToSuggest"; at this point, we assume that
the player character's curiosity about the topic has been satisfied,
since they've asked about it and received our response.

<p>The default value of timesToSuggest is 1.  So, by default, a
suggestion is removed from inventory after the first time it's used.
In cases where a topic entry has several sequential responses, you'll
usually want to keep suggesting the topic until the full sequence has
been exhausted, so in these cases you would want to override
timesToSuggest to use the higher value.  If you set timesToSuggest to
nil, it eliminates any limit.

<h3>When is the topic inventory list shown?</h3>

<p>There are three ways the topic inventory can be displayed:

<p>
<ul>
<li>in response to a TOPICS command from the player;
<li>in response to a TALK TO command from the player;
<li>any other time the game (or library) thinks it's a good idea.
</ul>

<p>The first way - an explicit TOPICS command - can serve as a sort
of hint system for the player.  When the player is talking to an NPC
and is feeling lost, she might ask for a list of topics to get back
on track.  If there are no suggested topics currently available, the
default library response is "You have nothing specific in mind right
now to discuss with &lt;the NPC&gt;."

<p>The second way - TALK TO - is less explicit.  The player is
saying they want to talk to the character, so we take the opportunity
to show any suggestions that are currently available.  However, if
there are no suggestions, there is no mention of the topic inventory -
there is no "you have nothing in mind" message in this case, because
the player didn't directly ask about the topic inventory.

<p>When a TALK TO is merely implied - that is, when the player's first
interaction with a character is an ASK, TELL, or whatever - then there
is no automatic topic inventory display.  The automatic display only
applies when the player actually types in the TALK TO command.

<p>Note that you can suppress the automatic topic inventory listing on
TALK TO commands by setting the property autoSuggest to nil in the
actor's state object.  This property is true by default.

<p>The third way of displaying the topic inventory is under game or
library control.  Any time you think it would make sense to tell the
player about the current topic inventory, you can do so explicitly.
There are two ways of doing this.  First, you can put a
&lt;.topics&gt; tag directly in any TopicEntry response text.  Second,
you can call the method conversationManager.scheduleTopicInventory().
With either of these mechanisms, a topic inventory listing will be
scheduled to appear immediately before the next command prompt.  The
library waits until the command prompt to display the inventory, so
that it isn't lost in the noise of any daemon or other output; since
this information is more than anything part of the command prompt, it
makes the most sense to display it right before the command prompt.

<p>The main time you'd want to automatically "push" a topic inventory
display on the player is when you intend for an NPC's response to a
question to suggest a follow-up question, but you don't want the
response text to have to telegraph it with a flashing blue hyperlink.
In other words, you feel that the NPC's response would suggest
something to the player <i>character</i>, within the context of the
story, but you're not as sure the <i>player</i> will pick up on the
cue.  In these cases, the topic inventory can be a useful device; it's
presented as a parenthetical comment, presumably from the story's
narrator, so it's relatively unintrusive but at the same time outside
of the literal exchange between the characters.

<p>In addition to topic inventory display under the game's control,
there's a time when the library automatically displays the inventory.
When an actor switches to a "conversation node" (more on this shortly)
in a threaded conversation, and that node includes one or more
"special topics" (more on this below, as well) the library
automatically schedules a topic inventory.  A special topic is one
that responds to a non-standard, custom command that's meaningful only
in that particular conversational context, so from a user interface
perspective, we simply have no choice but to disclose these to the
player whenever they're available.  Because these commands don't
conform to any general syntax rules that the user is accustomed to,
and because they're only usable in their limited context, it would be
grossly unfair to force the player to guess at them.  Therefore,
any time a conversation node with special topics becomes active,
the library automatically triggers a topic inventory listing.


<h2 id="greeting">Greeting protocols</h2>

<p>Plain ASK/TELL interactions tend to make it all too obvious that an
NPC is basically a reference book in which you look up topics, the
only clear difference being that the command involved is ASK rather
than LOOK UP.  In real life, you don't just walk up to someone and
start asking questions without first at least getting their attention.
And once you're in a conversation, it's awfully rude to just wander
off without giving some kind of indication that you're done talking.

<p>On the other hand, players don't want to have to describe every
little detail of each action.  Players don't want to have to describe
the detailed steps of UNLOCK DOOR, for example: it would be ludicrous
to have to type a series of commands like HOLD KEY, MOVE HAND TO LOCK,
PUT KEY IN LOCK, TURN KEY NINETY DEGREES CLOCKWISE, PUSH DOOR, etc.
It would be equally annoying to have to type in SAY HELLO, MAKE SMALL
TALK, SAY LOOK AT THE TIME I'D BETTER BE GOING, and so on.

<p>The TADS 3 library provides a solution to both problems: it allows
for greetings and goodbyes, but makes them automatic, so that they're
implied in ASK, TELL, and the like.  Specifically, the library lets
you set up an actor so that it keeps track of its conversation state.
When the player targets the actor with a conversational command such
as ASK, TELL, GIVE, or SHOW, the actor will automatically display its
"greeting" message - this message should make it clear that we're
soliciting the actor's attention, and that the actor accepts our
invitation to converse with us.  The actor then remembers that it's in
conversation with us, so subsequent conversation commands will just
continue the conversation, without generating another greeting.
Further, the actor watches for us to depart, and keeps track of how
long it's been since the last conversation command; if we leave, or if
too much time elapses, the actor terminates the conversation of its
own volition.  The actor can optionally display a "goodbye" message
upon terminating the discussion, to let us know that we no longer have
the actor's attention.

<p>Here's an example of how this might look in practice:

<p><pre>
  An older man is here, sweeping the porch.

  &gt;ask man about town
  "Excuse me," you say.

  The man sees you and stops sweeping.  "Howdy, stranger.  What can
  I do you for?"

  "What can you tell me about the town?" you ask.

  The man looks up and down the empty street.  "Well, not much to
  tell, really.  Just the same as it's been since I got here
  back in 67."

  &gt;ask about store
  "Is this your store?" you ask.

  He visibly lights up.  "Yep, sure is.  Worked here 'til I had
  enough to buy it, and now I guess I still work here."

  &gt;east
  The man returns to his sweeping.

  <b>Main Street</b>
  The pavement of this wide street is broken in places with [...]
</pre>

<p>This is fairly easy to set up.  To do so you'd probably 
define two ActorStates, the first in which  the actor is
receptive to conversational commands, but rather than simply responding
to them and carrying on, switches to a separate "in-conversation" state.
In the example above, the man stops sweeping when approached with a
question: he switches from his "sweeping" state to his "conversing"
state, to model the fact that the player has the man's attention.

<p>To create this kind of behavior, you'd define the "sweeping" state
as an ActorState that describes its actor as engaged in sweeping  You'd
define the state just like you would an ordinary ActorState. 
<p>Inside this ActorState, you can define some special
TopicEntry objects to provide the messages that are displayed as
we start the conversation and indicate which ActorState to switch
to once the conversation is underway.

<ul>

<li>HelloTopic - put a HelloTopic inside the first ActorState
to provide the message shown when we begin a conversation.  By
default, a HelloTopic object will handle both the explicit kind of
greeting, where the player types HELLO or TALK TO to start the
conversation, and also the implicit kind of greeting, where the
player just jumps directly into the conversation by starting with an
ASK ABOUT command or the like.  If you also put an ImpHelloTopic
inside the state, though, the HelloTopic will handle only the
explicit HELLO and TALK TO cases.  As with other topic entry types,
you can combine this with things like ShuffledEventList to add
variety by providing multiple greetings.  For greetings, a good
approach is to provide one or two initial, sequential messages,
appropriate for the first-time introduction and maybe one return
visit, and then a set of interchangeable shuffled messages for
subsequent visits.  This gives the NPC a bit of a memory by making it
clear that the NPC doesn't know the player character initially, but
then recognizes that it's the same character returning later.

<li>ImpHelloTopic - put this inside the first ActorState if you
want to provide a different message for implied greetings.  This will
be used instead of the HelloTopic when the conversation starts
without an explicit HELLO or TALK TO command.

<li>ExpHelloTopic - put this inside the ActorState if you only want 
to respond to an explicit greeting.</li>

<li>On any of these "hello" Topics, you can define a changeToState
property which defines the ActorState the actor should switch to following 
the greating, e.g. <code>changeToState = bobTalking</code>.
</ul>

<p>Then, on the conversational ActorState you can define one or more
TopicEntries to handle ending the conversation:</p>

<ul>
<li>ByeTopic - put this inside the conversational ActorState to handle
explicit GOODBYE commands from the player.  This will be used <b>only</b>
for explicit goodbyes.

<li>ImpByeTopic - put this inside the state to handle implicit
conversation endings.  The conversation ends implicitly when the
player character walks away from the conversation in progress (via a
GO NORTH command, for example), or the NPC gets bored of being
ignored (this is controlled with the attentionSpan property, as
explained below).  This is used <b>only</b> for implied conversation
endings, never for explicit goodbyes.  In the example above, this
would display the message "The man returns to his sweeping."

<li>ExpByeTopic - put this inside the state to handle explicit
conversation endings only.</li>

<li>ActorHelloTopic - put this inside the conversational ActorState 
to providde the response if the Actor decides to end the conversation.</li>


<li>On any of these "goodbye" Topics you can define a changeToState
property which defines the ActorState the actor should switch to following 
the goodbye, e.g. <code>changeToState = bobSweeping</code>. Note that this 
does not have to be the same state as the one the actor switched from 
when the conversation started; after all, it may be that the conversation 
changed the actor's mind about what they should be doing next!</li>
</ul>

<p>(Note for users coming from adv3: In adv3Lite there is no ConversationReadyState 
or InConversationState class, and the rule about which state to put HelloTopics 
and GoodByeTopics is a little different: in adv3Lite the Hello and Goodbye Topics 
should be located in the ActorState that's expected to be acitve at the point 
the greeting or farewell is issued).</p>

<p>The converational ActorState can also define an attentionSpan
property  - this is an integer giving the number of turns the
actor should wait before giving up on the conversation.  If the other 
character doesn't talk to our NPC for this many turns,
we'll automatically terminate the conversation. The default is
nil, meaning the Actor will never terminate the conversation this 
way.


<p>Here's an example of how we might implement the conversation shown above.

<p><pre>
  bob: Actor 'Bob;;;him'
    // normal definitions for 'bob'...
  ;

  + bobSweeping: ActorState 
    specialDesc = "An older man is here, sweeping the porch. "
    stateDesc = "He's sweeping the porch. "
    
    isInitState = true
  ;

++ HelloTopic, StopEventList
      ['&lt;q&gt;Excuse me,&lt;/q&gt; you say.
       &lt;.p&gt;The man sees you and stops sweeping.  &lt;q&gt;Howdy, stranger.
       What can I do you for?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;.p&gt;',

       '&lt;q&gt;Hello,&lt;/q&gt; you say.
       '&lt;.p&gt;The man stops sweeping and squints at you.
       &lt;q&gt;Oh, hello again.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;.p&gt;',

       '&lt;q&gt;Hello,&lt;/q&gt; you say.
       &lt;.p&gt;Howdy,&lt;/q&gt; the man replies, halting his sweeping.&lt;.p&gt;'] 
       
       changeToState = bobTalking
  ;

  + bobTalking: ActorState
    specialDesc = "An older man is here, leaning on his broom, talking
      with you. "
    stateDesc = "He's leaning on his broom while you talk. "
  ;
  

  ++ ByeTopic, StopEventList
      ['&lt;q&gt;Thanks,&lt;/q&gt; you say.  He nods and returns to sweeping.&lt;.p&gt;']
      
      changeToState = bobSweeping
  ;

  ++ ImpByeTopic, StopEventList
      ['The man returns to his sweeping. ',
       'The man goes back to sweeping the porch. ']
       
     changeToState = bobSweeping
  ;
</pre>

<p>Note how we use a customized state object to describe the man's
state while the conversation is ongoing.  This lets us override the
description messages, so that we don't describe his as sweeping whiles
he's talking to us.  This reinforces the sense that we're actually
having a conversation with the character, rather than just a series of
isolated question-answer exchanges superimposed on his background
behavior.  

<p>As you can see, the state mechanism takes care of most of the
coding; nearly all you have to do is provide the text of the
greetings.  For characters with any significant conversational
interaction, the extra work writing the greeting messages might be
well worthwhile.  For very simple characters, though, it's probably
not worth the added work.  If a character only responds meaningfully
to a couple of topics, it's probably easier to "fake it" with a little
extra text right in the topic responses.

<h3>Topic entry nesting with conversation states</h3>

<p>When you create a non-conversational ActorState and a corresponding
conversational  State, and you want to create topics entry objects
(AskTopic, AskTellTopic, etc.) that are specific to the conversation,
you should be sure to put the topic entries inside the
conversational State.  The same thing applies to TopicGroup objects.

<p>If, because of the greeting topics you define,
the non-conversational AcgtorState always switches the
actor to the conversational ActorState upon receiving any conversational
command (ASK, TELL, etc.), the non-conversational State will never
be in effect long enough to field any topic look-ups.  Thus, if you
were to put any topic entries inside such a non-converastional 
ActorState, they'd never be found.

<h3>Greetings and NPC memory</h3>

<p>There's a detail we glossed over in the code example above.  We
defined the greeting messages for the "sweeping" state so that when
we go back and talk to the NPC a second or third time, the NPC seems
to remember having talked to us before.

<p>If the NPC does nothing but sweep the porch, the implementation
above is fine.  But what if the NPC has other ready-for-conversation
states?  Then we have a problem: if we first greet the man while he's
sweeping the porch, and then we go back and talk to him again while
he's stacking soup cans, we'll get a first-time greeting.  The NPC's
"memory" of having talked to us is nothing more than the position in
the greeting StopEventList.  If we have two states, each with its own
list of greetings, we'll see each separate state's greeting list
separately.

<p>An easy way of dealing with this is to coordinate the greeting
lists of the different states.  The library has a built-in coordination
mechanism: the SyncEventList, which ties its own position to that of
a separate "master" event list.  Here's how we could extend the 
example above to handle NPC memory across multiple states:

<p><pre>
  bob: Actor 'Bob;;;him'
    // normal definitions for 'bob'...
  ;

  + bobSweeping: ActorState // ...same as before...
  
  ++ bobSweepingHello: HelloTopic, StopEventList
    // same definitions as earlier
  ;

  + bobTalking: ActorState // ...same as before...
  

  ++ ByeTopic, StopEvenList // ...same as before...

  ++ ImpByeTopic // ...same as before...

  + bobStackingState: ActorState
    specialDesc = "An older man is here, unpacking
      a crate of soup cans and building a pyramid out of the cans. "
    stateDesc = "He's unpacking a crate of soup cans, building a
      pyramid out of the cans. "
      
    +++ HelloTopic, SyncEventList
    ['&lt;q&gt;Excuse me,&lt;/q&gt; you say.
     &lt;.p&gt;The man puts down his soup cans and turns to
     talk with you.  &lt;q&gt;Howdy, stranger. What can I do you
     for?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;.p&gt;',

     '&lt;q&gt;Hello,&lt;/q&gt; you say.
     '&lt;.p&gt;The man stops stacking cans and squints at you.
     &lt;q&gt;Oh, hello again.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;.p&gt;',

     '&lt;q&gt;Hello,&lt;/q&gt; you say.
     &lt;.p&gt;Howdy,&lt;/q&gt; the man replies, setting aside his
     can-stacking to talk.&lt;.p&gt;']

    masterObject = bobSweepingHello
    
    changeToState = bobTalking2
  ;
  

  + bobTalking2: ActorState
    specialDesc = "An older man is here, standing next to a partially-built
      pyramid of soup cans, talking with you. "
    stateDesc = "He's standing next to the soup can pyramid while you talk. "
  ; 
</pre>

<p>We've added the second converastional and
non-conversational state pair, for a new state where the character is
building a pyramid out of soup cans.  This time, we created a greeting
list using a SyncEventList rather than a StopEventList, and we pointed
the SyncEventList to the event list from the "sweeping" state, by
setting the SyncEventList's masterObject property.  This is why we had
to give the original HelloTopic  a name: we need to refer
to it in the masterObject property of the synchronized list.

<p>Now that we've tied the two greeting lists together, they'll
automatically stay synchronized.  This means that once we see the
first greeting in one of the lists, we won't see the first greeting in
the other list in a subsequent conversation, because both lists will
advance their positions in unison.

<p>For more details of Greeting Protocols in adv3Lite, see the 
<a href='../manual/hello.htm'>Hello and Goodbye</a> chapter in 
the <i>Adv3Lite Library Manual</i>.

<h2>Threaded conversations</h2>

<p>Greeting protocols provide some sense of continuity to
conversations, but they only go so far.  Still missing is any sense
that there's a subject being discussed, or that there's any
connection at all between one ASK ABOUT and the next.  Real
conversations aren't usually strings of isolated non sequiturs whose
temporal proximity is mere coincidence; each new utterance in a real
conversation builds on what's been said up to that point.  It would
be better if our simulated IF conversations could also have a
"thread" that connects the individual pieces.

<p>The TADS 3 library has some special mechanisms that can help
create a threaded conversation.  These features can be used in
various ways.  For the ultimate in threading, you could use the
library mechanisms as the basis for a menu-based conversation system,
but these features are primarily designed for the standard ASK/TELL
model with some slight augmentation.

<h3>NPC memory within a topic</h3>

<p>A simple way to create a sense of context to conversations is to
give NPCs some memory of what they've already said.  A simple way to
do this is to avoid letting an NPC repeat himself by using a
ShuffledEventList or a StopEventList to provide mutiple answers to the
same question, rather than just using a single answer.  For example:

<p><pre>
  + TellTopic, StopEventList @lighthouse
    ['&lt;q&gt;I was in the lighthouse earlier today,&lt;/q&gt; you say.
    &lt;.p&gt;Bob becomes quite flustered. &lt;q&gt;What are you talking about?
    That thing was torn down years ago, after the...\ troubles.&lt;/q&gt; ',

    '&lt;q&gt;About the lighthouse...&lt;/q&gt; you start.
    &lt;.p&gt;&lt;q&gt;Why do you keep going on about that?  I thought
    I told you, it was torn down year ago.&lt;/q&gt; ',

    '&lt;q&gt;What did you say about the lighthouse?&lt;/q&gt; you ask.
    &lt;.p&gt;&lt;q&gt;Why do you keep asking me that?  It was torn down
    after the troubles.&lt;/q&gt; ']
  ;
</pre>

<p>We've used a StopEventList, which means that we'll show the list
entries in order until we reach the last one, and then we'll just
repeat the last one from then on.  Note that on the last entry, we
just summarize and repeat what we've said before.  This provides a
good compromise between realism and playability: it creates the
impression that the character remembers that we've asked before, but
it still lets the player go back and ask again any time in case
they've forgotten any important clue or other information that was
revealed.

<p>You could also use a ShuffledEventList to provide the responses in
a random order, although that would be best when variety is the goal
rather than a sense of NPC memory.  This would be most suitable for
throw-away topics that are mostly there for amusement value.

<p>Creating a list of responses is obviously a little more work than
creating just one response - not so much in terms of programming as
in writing - and you probably won't want to go to this much trouble
for every topic, or even for most topics.  For the handful of really
important topics, though, it can be worthwhile.

<h3>NPC memory across topics</h3>

<p>As we just saw, changing an NPC's response to a repeated question
helps create the impression that the NPC is paying attention, but
there's more to the thread of a conversation than simple repetition.
It would also be nice if responses could take into account other
topics that have already been discussed.  One simple example is that
some topics might not even be known to the player character until
they come up in conversation, so we wouldn't want to answer these
topics until they had come up:

<p><pre>
  &gt;ask bob about troubles
  "Have you heard of any troubles around here?"

  "Eh?"  Bob look puzzled.

  &gt;ask bob about lighthouse
  "I was at the lighthouse earlier today," you start.

  Bob becomes quite flustered.  "What are you talking about?
  That thing was torn down years ago, after the... troubles.

  &gt;ask bob about troubles
  "What troubles?" you ask.

  Bob stares down the street.  He just stands there until you're
  about to repeat the question, then looks back at you and shakes
  his head.  "There are things you wish you didn't know.  Believe
  me, this is one of them."
</pre>

<p>This kind of cross-topic memory is easily set up using the isActive
property.  In this example, we could define two topic entries for "the
troubles."  The first one would be the default, giving the "Bob looks
puzzled" response; the second would be an AltTopic nested within the
first, and would include an isActive condition that makes the topic
available only after bob has been asked about the lighthouse.

<p>How do we define this condition?  The library provides a special
mechanism that makes it easy to keep track of what information one
topic has revealed, and then to test for that revelation in another
topic.  The way to do this is with the special &lt;.reveal key&gt;
tag.  This isn't a real HTML tag; the library recognizes it and
filters it out of any output.  The tag has an effect, though: the
library adds the "key" value - which is any arbitrary text of your
choosing - to a global lookup table as soon as the text is shown.  You
can then refer to that lookup table using gRevealed('key').  This returns
true if the 'key' value has been revealed using the &lt;.reveal&gt;
tag, nil if not.

<p>Here's how we'd use the &lt;.reveal&gt; tag to set up the
conversation shown above.

<p><pre>
  Bob: Actor // ...etc...
  ;

  + AskTellTopic @lighthouse
    "&lt;.reveal troubles&gt;&lt;q&gt;I was in the lighthouse earlier today,&lt;/q&gt;
    you start.
    &lt;.p&gt;Bob becomes quite flustered. &lt;q&gt;What are you talking about?
    That thing was torn down years ago, after the...\ troubles.&lt;/q&gt; "
  ;

  + AskTellTopic @troublesTopic
    "[Bob looks puzzled...]"
  ;

  ++ AltTopic
    "[There are things you wish you didn't know...]"

    isActive = gRevealed('troubles')
  ;
</pre>

<p>As long as we haven't asked Bob about the lighthouse, we'll get the
"Bob looks puzzled" response when we ask about the troubles, because
the key 'troubles' hasn't been revealed yet.  As soon as we show the
response to ASK BOB ABOUT LIGHTHOUSE, the &lt;.reveal troubles&gt; tag
kicks in, which inserts the 'troubles' key into the global table of
revealed information.  This causes gRevealed('troubles') to return
true, which makes the AltTopic active, so from that point on we use the
AltTopic for the response to ASK BOB ABOUT TROUBLES.

<p>Note that the "revelation keys" are just an arbitrary strings.
These have no meaning at all to the library; the library simply adds a
key to the table when it's used in a &lt;.reveal&gt; tag in the
output, and it looks up a key in the table when you use gRevealed() to
request the key's status.  Note in particular that these keys are
<b>not</b> object names, so you don't have to worry about using names
that are different from any object or class names in your game.

<p>Also note that you can mark a key as revealed without having to
display any text.  Just use the macro gReveal('key') - this explicitly
adds the key to the table of revealed keys.

<h3>Conversation trees</h3>

<p>The specific wording in the example above has a slight problem.
If the player doesn't ask about the troubles right away, but comes
back and asks Bob about the topic later, they'll get a rather
non sequitur response.

<p><pre>
  &gt;ask bob about store
  "Is this your store?"

  He visibly lights up.  "Yep, sure is.  Worked here 'til I had
  enough to buy it, and now I guess I still work here."

  &gt;ask bob about troubles
  "What troubles?" you ask.

  Bob stares down the street...
</pre>

<p>The problem is that we wrote the response text for the "troubles"
topic assuming that the player would ask about it right away.  That's
fine as long as they do, but it would be unwise to count on it.  If
the player asks later, it would be better to use an exchange like this:

<p><pre>
  &gt;ask bob about troubles
  "What were the 'troubles' you mentioned earlier?" you ask.

  Bob stares down the street...
</pre>

<p>You could solve this by counting turns or something like that, but
there's a better way, which is to use the library's "conversation
tree" system.  This feature lets you create a map of sorts for the
flow of a conversation.  At any given time, a conversation is in a
"location" in the tree; the location is simply an object you create to
represent the conversational options at that point.

<p>In some ways, conversation trees are similar to menu-based
conversations.  If you think about conversation menus, you can picture
each menu as a location on a map, and each of the items on the menu as
an exit leading to a new location.  Each time the user selects an
option, we move on the map to the new location connected to that item,
which gives us a new menu to display and a new set of exits to other
locations.

<p>(We call this structure a "tree" because of the way each location
branches to several other locations, which in turn branch to several
other locations, and so on.  To be fully accurate, it's not really a
tree in the strict computer-science sense of the term; a tree doesn't
have branches that loop back on themselves, and doesn't have branches
that split and later rejoin.  A computer scientist would actually call
our structure a "directed graph"; but that term isn't an especially
vivid metaphor for most people, so we'll stick with "tree.")

<p>There are a few big differences between our ASK/TELL trees and
typical menu trees, though.  First, conversation trees are completely
optional; you can use all of the other conversation features we've
talked about so far without even knowing about conversation trees.
Second, whereas menu-based conversations are usually limited to what's
on the menu, ASK/TELL trees are usually just a supplement: we use them
to custom-tailor selected topics to the context, but we accept any
other topics as well.  Third, the tree structure of a conversation is
readily apparent to the player when menus are used, as all of the
options are always laid out in plain sight; our conversation trees are
internal constructs that the user can't see directly, and might not
even notice.

<h4>The ConvNode object</h4>

<p>Conversation trees are represented with ConvNode objects.  Each
ConvNode defines one location in the conversation; it specifies how to
handle any ASK, TELL, or other conversational command.  At any given
time, an NPC <i>can</i> have a current ConvNode object, but need not.
If an actor doesn't have a current ConvNode object, then we use the
standard non-tree handling.  Note that only one ConvNode can be active
for an NPC at a time (so an NPC can be in only one "location" in a
conversation at a time).

<p>A conversation node has one main task: it serves as a container for
TopicEntry objects.  (Yes, this is yet another place you can put topic
entries.)  The topic entries that are nested within a ConvNode apply
only when that ConvNode is active, and when the node is active, they
override any other matching topic entries that are defined elsewhere
(such as in the Actor, or in the ActorState).  That's what makes
ConvNodes useful - you can use them to define special responses that
apply only when the conversation is in that particular position.

<p>A ConvNode object must always be associated directly with an Actor
object, by locating the ConvNode within the Actor.  Normally, you'd
do this by using the "+" syntax:

<p><pre>
  Bob: Actor
    // ...
  ;

  + ConvNode 'lighthouse';
</pre>

<p>A ConvNode object can also go inside an ActorState object, but note
that this has exactly the same effect as putting it inside the
associated Actor directly - it doesn't actually create any association
between the ConvNode and the ActorState object.  The library lets you
put a ConvNode inside an ActorState purely for convenience, to give
you more flexibility in how you arrange your source code.

<h4>Entering and navigating a tree</h4>

<p>By default, there is no conversation tree in effect.  So how do we
get into a tree in the first place, and once we're in a tree, how do
we navigate through it?

<p>In most cases, we use the same mechanism to both enter and navigate
a tree: we use the &lt;.convnode name&gt; tag in a response's text.
This is a special pseudo-tag, not a real HTML tag; the library strips
this tag out of any displayed text before the user sees it.  When
the tag is used in output text, though, the library automatically switches
the NPC that issued the response to the named conversation node.  The
name is just a string; you use the same string to identify the ConvNode
when you define it.  We'll see an example shortly.

<p>Note that the &lt;.convnode&gt; tag can be used <b>only</b> within
a TopicEntry's response text (or the actorSay() method of an AgendaItem).
The tag has this restriction because
the library doesn't have any idea which actor is supposed to be
switching to the new ConvNode in other contexts.  The library only
knows which actor is involved when the actor is specifically
displaying a response via a TopicEntry.  If you need to switch to
a new conversation node at any other time, you should use the
setConvNode() method on the actor involved.

<h4>Leaving a ConvNode</h4>

<p>One obvious way to leave a ConvNode is to go to a new ConvNode.
This is what happens when you display text that includes a
&lt;.convnode&gt; tag.  Another is to explicitly change the node
by calling the setConvNode() method on the Actor object.

<p>In addition, the library leaves a conversation node automatically
after a response that <i>doesn't</i> include a &lt;.convnode&gt; or
&lt;.convstay&gt; tag.  This happens because a conversation node is
usually relevant only to what came immediately before; if we veer off
onto a topic that isn't specifically associated with a new ConvNode,
then we probably want to simply leave the tree.

<p>If you want to avoid leaving a conversation node automatically
after a response, simply put a &lt;.convstay&gt; tag within the
response text.  This tells the library to stay put at the same
conversation node that was in effect just before the response.

<p>When something attempts to terminate the conversation, if
there's a current ConvNode in the actor, the state object (or rather a 
NodeEndCheck object located within the Convode) calls its (the NEC's) 
canEndConversation (reason) to let the node object to ending the conversation.
For example, if the ConvNode
represents a point in the conversation where the NPC is expecting the
player to answer a question, the ConvNode could let the NPC voice an
objection to cutting off the conversation with the question
unanswered. In most situations, this behaviour can be defined on 
properties on the ConvNode object (such as sayBlockBye or sayBlockLeave) 
without our needing to explicitly define a NodeEndCheck object.</p>

<h4>Topic entries inside ConvNodes</h4>

<p>The most important way that a ConvNode controls the conversation
flow is by specifying special responses that apply to that position in
the conversation.  To specify special responses for a ConvNode, simply
put the topics inside the ConvNode object (using the "+" syntax).

<p>When you put a topic entry inside a ConvNode, the topic will only
be available when the ConvNode is current.  What's more, the topic
entry overrides any other matching topic entry, no matter what the
relative scores - the ConvNode has precedence over the actor's
topic database and the actor's state's database.

<p>The ConvNode's ability to override every other response for a topic
is perfect for the "troubles" example.  Recall that we wanted two
ways of phrasing the response to ASK BOB ABOUT TROUBLES: one for
right after Bob initially mentioned the troubles in his response to
ASK BOB ABOUT LIGHTHOUSE, and a different one for any other time.
We can accomplish this by creating a ConvNode object to represent
the position in the conversation right after the LIGHTHOUSE response,
and putting our special TROUBLES response inside the ConvNode.
If the player asks about the troubles right away, we'll use the
special response contained in the ConvNode object; at any other
time, we'll get the regular response.

<p><pre>
  Bob: Actor // ...
  ;

  + AskTellTopic @lighthouse
    "&lt;.reveal troubles&gt;&lt;.convnode after-lighthouseq&gt;I was in the lighthouse
    earlier today,&lt;/q&gt; you start.
    &lt;.p&gt;Bob becomes quite flustered. &lt;q&gt;What are you talking about?
    That thing was torn down years ago, after the...\ troubles.&lt;/q&gt; "
  ;

  // define the *ordinary* responses to the TROUBLES topic
  + AskTellTopic @troublesTopic
    "[Bob looks puzzled...] "
  ;
  ++ AltTopic
    "&lt;q&gt;What were the &lt;q&gt;troubles&lt;/q&gt; you mentioned earlier?&lt;/q&gt;
    &lt;.p&gt;Bob stares down the street [...]"

    isActive = gRevealed('troubles')
  ;

  // conversation position after ASK BOB ABOUT LIGHTHOUSE
  + ConvNode 'after-lighthouse';

  // a special response when we're in this conversation position
  ++ AskTellTopic @troublesTopic
    "&lt;q&gt;What troubles&lt;/q&gt; you ask.
    &lt;.p&gt;Bob stares down the street [...]"
  ;
</pre>

<p>Note that we haven't changed all that much from the earlier
incarnation of this example.  One change is that we've reworded the
AltTopic text for the "troubles" response so that it no longer assumes
that Bob just mentioned the troubles: rather than starting with simply
"What troubles?", we start with "What were the 'troubles' you
mentioned earlier?"  The only other changes relate to the new ConvNode
object: we've added a &lt;.convnode&gt; tag to the "lighthouse" response,
we've added the ConvNode object itself, and we've added yet another
response for "the troubles," this time nested within the new ConvNode.

<p>With this new set-up, ASK BOB ABOUT LIGHTHOUSE will automatically
set Bob's current conversation tree position to our new ConvNode
object.  Once we're in this conversation position,
ASK BOB ABOUT TROUBLES will use the special response nested within
the ConvNode object.  At any other time, we fall back on the ordinary
responses.

<p>Note that the association between a &lt;.convnode&gt; tag and a
ConvNode object is made by the name of the ConvNode, which is just an
arbitrary string value.  In the example, this is the string
'after-lighthouse' that appears in the ConvNode object definition.
This string is found through a global lookup table that the library
maintains; this lookup table contains all of the ConvNode objects in
the entire game, keyed by their names.  ConvNode names must thus be
unique.  However, they don't have to conform to the usual object
naming rules, since they're just arbitrary strings, and they only have
to be unique relative to other ConvNode names - there's no need to
worry about reusing names that are used by other kinds of game
objects.

<h4><a name='exclusiveConvNodes'>ConvNodes with exclusive responses</a></h4>

<p>We mentioned earlier that the library will automatically exit the
conversation tree (that is, the library will set the actor's current
ConvNode to nil) when the actor gives a response that doesn't specify
a new ConvNode.  In some cases, you won't want to allow the
conversation to veer off to an arbitrary different topic like this.

<p>The easy way to limit the conversation like this, to avoid veering
off-topic, is to include a default response inside the ConvNode, and
have the default response return to the same ConvNode.  For example,
suppose that once we've asked Bob about "the troubles," we don't want
to allow changing the subject.  Here's how we could do this,
continuing our earlier example.

<p><pre>
  // conversation position after ASK BOB ABOUT LIGHTHOUSE
  + ConvNode 'after-lighthouse';

  // a special response when were in this conversation position
  ++ AskTellTopic @troublesTopic
    "&lt;.convnode troubles&gt;&lt;q&gt;What troubles&lt;/q&gt; you ask.
    &lt;.p&gt;Bob stares down the street [...]"
  ;

  // conversation position when talking about the troubles
  + ConvNode 'troubles';

  ++ AskTellTopic, StopEventList @troublesTopic
    ['&lt;.convnode troubles&gt;&lt;q&gt;I really need to know.&lt;/q&gt;
      &lt;.p&gt;Bob shakes his head. &lt;q&gt;You just think you need to know,&lt;/q&gt;
      he says scornfully. &lt;q&gt;That\'s what I thought, once.&lt;/q&gt; ',

     '&lt;.convnode troubles&gt;&lt;q&gt;Pretty please?&lt;/q&gt;
      &lt;.p&gt;Oh, all right, but you have to promise not to tell
      anybody else.&lt;/q&gt; ',

     /* and so on */ ]
  ;

  ++ DefaultAskTellTopic
    "&lt;.convnode troubles&gt;Bob cuts you off. &lt;q&gt;I don't want to
    talk about that.&lt;/q&gt; "
  ;
</pre>

<p>This works because of the way that ConvNode topic entries override
everything else.  By putting a default response within the ConvNode,
you ensure that no topic outside of the ConvNode can ever be matched.
If the player asks about anything not otherwise handled in the ConvNode,
we'll show the default response, which explicitly returns to the same
ConvNode.  There we'll stay, until we ask about something that takes
us to a new node, or we just give up and leave the conversation.

<p>When the conversation options are limited like this, it's sometimes
better to limit the topic inventory list to match.  See the
"<a href='#activeTopicInventory'>active topic inventory</a>" section
above for details on how to do this.

<h4>Using a ConvNode to await a reply</h4>

<p>One interesting way you can use the default topic pattern above is
for questions asked by the NPC.  Most IF authors strictly avoid having
NPCs ask questions, because it's too thorny to deal with the range of
possible inputs.  Using the ConvNode system, though, you can actually
handle questions pretty easily.

<p>The trick is to define a default response that says something
like "Bob is waiting for your answer."  If the player tries to change
the subject by asking about another topic, they'll just get this
default response.  The NPC will stay in the ConvNode until the player
uses TELL ABOUT, or YES or NO, to answer the question.  You handle the
answer by defining, for example, a TellTopic for the topic that serves
as the answer.

<p>It's probably not a great idea to use this approach to open-ended
questions that require a TELL ABOUT response, unless the answer is
pretty obvious.  For better playability, questions that demand an
answer should usually be answerable with YES or NO.  Fortunately,
the ConvNode makes it easy to handle these responses: simply define
a YesTopic and a NoTopic within the ConvNode.  YesTopic and NoTopic
are just like ordinary topic entries, but they respond to YES and
NO respectively.  Of course, there's no need for an "@topic" or
topic list definition when creating a YesTopic or NoTopic.

<p>Here's an example of a simple conversation where the NPC puts a
series of YES/NO questions to the player character.

<p><pre>
  Bob: Actor // ...
  ;

  + AskTellTopic @troublesTopic
    "&lt;q&gt;What were the &lt;q&gt;troubles&lt;/q&gt; you mentioned earlier?&lt;/q&gt;
    &lt;.p&gt;Bob gets all dark and serious.  &lt;q&gt;Are you absolutely sure
    you want to know?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;.convnode askOnce&gt; "
  ;

  + ConvNode 'askOnce';
  ++ YesTopic
    "&lt;q&gt;Sure,&lt;/q&gt; you say.
    &lt;.p&gt;&lt;q&lt;I don't think you understand.  There are things that a
    man wishes and prays he'd never known, things that will haunt your 
    dreams, fill your nights with fear and your days with bitterness and
    anger, shatter your illusions about goodness and justice in the world,
    turn hope into just another lie, make you suspicious of everyone you
    meet and everyone you've ever known, open your eyes to the cold, hard
    truth about this miserable existence called life.  Once you know what I
    know, you can never go back, things can never be the same for you.  Now,
    are you &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; sure you want to hear 
    this?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;.convnode askTwice&gt; "
  ;
  ++ NoTopic
    "Something about Bob's manner is a little frightening.
     &lt;q&gt;Uh, maybe not.&lt;/q&gt;
     &lt;.p&gt;&lt;q&gt;Good choice,&lt;/q&gt; Bob says, seeming relieved. "
  ;

  + ConvNode 'askTwice';
  // etc with another YesTopic and NoTopic
</pre>

<p>When the player asks about "the troubles," we'll show the
AskTellTopic's response text.  This contains a &lt;.convnode
askOnce&gt; tag, which sets Bob's current ConvNode to the one labeled
'askOnce'.  On the next turn, since this ConvNode is active, it will
be the first place that we look for a response to the player's
command, so if the player types YES or NO (or various alternative
phrasings, such as "BOB, YES" or "SAY NO TO BOB"), we'll activate the
YesTopic or NoTopic within the ConvNode.  The YesTopic response has
another &lt;.convnode&gt; tag, this time taking us to the 'askTwice'
node.  So, if the player answers YES, then we'll use the responses in
the 'askTwice' node for the next turn.  

<p>Note that, because we didn't include a default response among the
ConvNode's responses, the player is free to change the subject
entirely rather than answer the question.  If they ASK ABOUT something
new, we'll just go off and find an appropriate TopicEntry elsewhere,
looking at the topics associated with the actor's current state and
then at the topics associated directly with the actor.

<h4>Special topics</h4>

<p>Conversations that involve only ASK, TELL, GIVE, and SHOW can feel
awfully limiting to the player and author alike, because they allow
no nuance of expression.  Some authors, seeking an alternative, have
resorted to menu-based conversations; nothing in the TADS 3 library
would prevent using conversation menus, and indeed they'd be a
natural fit with the ConvNode threading system, but the conversation
system doesn't provide direct support for menus.  Instead, the
library provides a menu-like alternative that seeks to retain more of
the flavor of the traditional text game user interface.

<p>This alternative is provided by something called the "special
topic," which is implemented by two subclasses of the SpecialTopic class:
SayTopic and QueryTopic. A special
topic is a kind of topic database entry (SpecialTopic is a subclass
of TopicEntry, just like AskTopic and TellTopic and the rest).  Like
the other kinds of topic entries, a special topic has response text
that's shown when the special topic is triggered, an isActive property
that determines whether or not the topic is available, and all of the
other standard TopicEntry properties.  The difference is that a
special topic isn't triggered by an ASK ABOUT command, or a TELL
ABOUT command, or any other conventional command.  Instead, a special
topic is triggered by a unique, custom command that the special topic
itself defines.  The custom command doesn't have to be defined as a
VerbRule or any other part of the normal grammar; special topics
bypass the normal parser.

<p>Here's an example of a conversation node that includes some
SayTopics:

<p><pre>
  Bob: Actor // ...
  ;

  + AskTellTopic @mary
    "&lt;q&gt;Mary told me all about how you cheated on her,&lt;/q&gt; you say,
    unable to disguise your contempt.
    &lt;.p&gt;Bob breaks down and starts blubbering.  &lt;q&gt;It wasn't my 
    fault!&lt;/q&gt; he sobs. &lt;q&gt;She drove me to it!&lt;/q&gt;
    &lt;.convnode affair&gt; "
  ;

  + ConvNode 'affair';
  ++ SayTopic 'comfort him; bob' 
    "&lt;q&gt;There, there [...] "
    
    includeSayinName = nil
  ;
  ++ SayTopic 'call him a liar; bob' 
    "&lt;q&gt;You're so full of crap, Bob [...] "
    
    includeSayinName = nil
  ;
</pre>

<p>Each SayTopic definition has two main standard pieces: the
string to show in the topic inventory list; the list of additional words that
will match against the player's input; and the response text.  The
inventory list string should be something that can be tagged onto
"you could..." (for the English version, at least; other languages
may vary).  The additional word list is simply a set of words that 
can match this SayTopic in addition to those in the name. The two 
are put together in a single string with a semicolon separating the two,
rather like a vocab string (in fact, it is a vocab string).

<p>There are several things to note about the way the library matches
player input to a special topic. Behind the scenes the library creates 
a Topic object that uses the SayTopic's vocab as its own vocab and will
be parsed in just the same way. This means that the SayTopic will be matched 
in just the same way as if we had defined a callHimALiar Topic with the same 
vocab and had written <code>SayTopic @callHimALiar</code>. There's one 
important difference though. Although SayTopics will match an explicit
SAY command (e.g., SAY COMFORT BOB), since this will often not be a natural 
way to phrase the command, if there is a conversation in progress, the parser 
will assume that any input it doesn't otherwise understand is an implicit 
SAY command with the SAY part missing (so that CALL HIM A LIAR will effectively
be parsed as SAY CALL HIM A LIAR). One downside of this is that if the vocabulary 
needed to trigger a SayTopic looks like a valid command, that command will be 
executed instead (though that probably won't happen often in practice and 
can probably be avoided with care).</p>

<p>The keyword list is easy to program, but sometimes it's not flexible
enough.  For cases where you need more control, you can replace the keyword
list with a single string containing an arbitrary regular expression.
If the entire player's input matches the regular expression, then the
special topic will match.

<p>Unlike in adv3, Special topics (SayTopics and QueryTopics) 
don't need to be nested within ConvNode objects; they can be used 
wherever any other kind of ActorTopicEntry can be used.

<p>Because a special topic's triggering command is completely custom,
it would be unreasonable to force the player to guess at its command.
Therefore, SpecialTopics are automatically entered into the topic
inventory as suggestions.  What's more, whenever a ConvNode becomes
active, and the ConvNode has one or more active special topic
objects, the library will automatically show a topic inventory
listing.  This means that the player will always be shown any
available special topics when they become available.

<p>The includeSayInName property of a SayTopic controls how a SayTopic 
is listed in a topic inventory. If includeSayInName is true (the default)
the SayTopic's name will be preceeded by "say" (e.g. "you could say you're
sorry"). If, as here, the "say" would look out of place, we can suppress 
it by setting includeSayInName to nil.

<p>A QueryTopic is similar to a SayTopic, except that it can be used 
to ask questions that don't conform to the ASK ABOUT WHATEVER format 
or ordinary AskTopics. For example we could use QueryTopics to handle 
commands like ASK BOB WHERE THE LIGHTHOUSE IS or ASK WHEN THE TROUBLES 
STARTED.

<p>In a way, special topics resemble conventional menu systems, since
they amount to enumerated lists of choices.  There are important
differences, though.  First, the topic inventory is much less
obtrusive than the typical menu display; the topic inventory list is
phrased as narration, so it fits smoothly with the rest of the game's
transcript.  Importantly, the list isn't displayed in a separate
window, or as a numbered or bulleted list; it's specifically designed
to fit in naturally with the surrounding text.  Second, the method of
input for the player is also consistent with the normal command-line
user interface: the user simply types in the command as suggested in
the topic inventory.  Third, the user interface isn't modal, as
conversation menus often are: the game shows an ordinary command
prompt, and the player can select a special topic if they want, but
can just as well enter any ordinary command.

chapter on <a href='../manual/specialtopic.htm'>Special Topics</a> in

<h2>NPC-driven conversations</h2>

<p>So far, the techniques we've covered handle cases where NPCs
respond to conversational commands from the player.  Sometimes, it's
desirable for NPCs to take the lead in striking up a conversation or
continuing an ongoing conversation.  The library has a few features
that can help.

<h3>NPC initiation</h3>

<p>First, let's consider how an NPC can start a conversation on its own.

<p>It's up to the author to decide exactly when an NPC initiates
a conversation.  The author must write some code that tests for the
triggering condition and starts the conversation when the condition
occurs.  There are three main places where you'd typically write this
kind of code:

<ul>

<li>In an NPC's background-action script, usually in the Actor's
takeTurn() method or the Actor's idleTurn() method.  This approach lets
the NPC start a conversation as part of its turn when some condition
has become true; for example, this could be used to start a conversation
as soon as the player character enters the NPC's location. Be careful 
when overriding this method, though, since it already does quite a bit 
of housekeeping, so you'd need to be sure to include a call to 
<code>inherited()</code> in any customization.</p>

<li>In the beforeAction() or afterAction() method of the Actor or
ActorState.  This lets the NPC start a conversation in response to a
command carried out by the player character in the NPC's presence.

<li>In the NPC's handler for a SensoryEvent (assuming the Sensory extension 
is present so that SensoryEvents can be defined).  This lets the NPC
initiate a conversation upon observing some transient event.

<li>By calling initiateTopic(top) on the actor object, which will trigger 
the matching InitiateTopic (a special kind of TopicEntry). 
</ul>

<p>For more information on NPC Initiation, see the chapter on 
<a href='../manual/initiate.htm'>NPC-Initiated Conversation</a>
in the <i>Adv3Lite Library Manual</i>,

<p><i>Note - the initiateConversation() method discuseed below doesn't exist in adv3Lite,
although a comment in the library code suggests it was once intended, 
so ignore this italicised section for now. I may go back and see if 
there's any merit in adding an initiateConversation() method to the 
adv3Lite Actor class in due course.</p>
<p>In any of these cases, the code you have to write in the NPC to
start a conversation is the same: you call the Actor's
initiateConversation(state, node) method.  The 'state' parameter is an
ActorState for the actor to enter; this can be nil if you don't want
to change the NPC's current state.  The new state is usually an
InConversationState - it doesn't have to be, but usually there's no
reason to use initiateConversation() at all unless you want the
conversation to have its own state.  The 'node' parameter is a
ConvNode object, or a string naming a ConvNode object.  This parameter
is required because the new ConvNode provides the initial exchange of
the conversation.

<p>The initiateConversation() method does several things.  It switches
the NPC to the new ActorState, if one was provided, and it switches to
the given ConvNode.  The method also sets the "current interlocutor"
properties for the NPC and the player character Actor objects to point
to one another.  Finally, the method invokes the new ConvNode's
npcInitiateConversation() method, which displays the initial exchange
of the conversation.

<p>To define the message for the initial exchange, you must define either
an npcGreetingMsg or npcGreetingList property in the ConvNode object.
If you only need a single message, you can define npcGreetingMsg to
a double-quoted string giving the initial exchange:

<p><pre>
  + ConvNode 'sales-1'
    npcGreetingMsg = "The salesman approaches you, smiling. &lt;q&gt;Hello,
      friend! My name is Ron, and I represent the Mutual Indemnity Life
      Insurance Company. I have a serious question for you: do you have
      enough life insurance?&lt;/q&gt; "
  ;
</pre>

<p>If you'll need to re-use the ConvNode to initiate the conversation
repeatedly, you might prefer to use a list of messages for the greeting,
to make the actor seem less mechanical.  You can do this by defining
the npcGreetingList property to refer to a EventList subclass.  For example:

<p><pre>
  + ConvNode 'sales-1'
    npcGreetingList: StopEventList {
    [
      'The salesman approaches you, smiling...',

      'The salesman walks up to you.  &lt;q&gt;Hello, again! I hope
      you\'ve thought more about your life insurance needs.&lt;/q&gt; '

      // etc...
    ] }
  ;
</pre>

<p>Once you have the NPC initiate a conversation, all of the library
conversation features work as usual.  This means that you can have an
NPC start a conversation with a question, using TopicEntry objects
within the initial ConvNode to handle the answers - you can use
YesTopic and NoTopic objects inside the ConvNode to handle YES and NO
answers to the NPC's question, for example.
</i>
<h3>NPC continuation</h3>

<p>It's unusual in IF for an NPC to take the lead in a conversation,
either by initiating a conversation or by asking a question as part
of an ongoing conversation.  This isn't because IF authors <i>want</i>
their NPCs to be purely passive; it's because it's more difficult to
program active NPCs.  We've seen how greeting protocols and
conversation trees can help maintain the illusion that the NPC is
aware of a conversation for more than one turn at a time, by making
the NPC react to different player actions in a way that's appropriate
to the ongoing conversation.  There's one piece missing, though: what
if the player doesn't keep up her end of the conversation?

<p>In a real-life conversation, if one of the participants asks a
question, and the other person doesn't answer, the questioner will
often persist: they might repeat the question, or ask why the other
person isn't answering.  Similarly, if neither participant in a
conversation says anything for a little while, one person might
offer something new to keep the conversation moving.

<p>The library has a feature that lets you simulate these effects,
so that the NPC can "continue" a conversation even if the player
is doing other things.  This feature can be managed through the ConvNode
object, because this keeps the NPC's continuation remarks together
with the conversation context.  Specifically, each ConvNode object
can optionally define the property nodeContinuationMsg as a double-quoted
string to display or as an EventList subclass, giving a list of strings 
to displa, or as a method to output text.

<p>The library automatically displays the current
ConvNode's continuation message (using either nodeContinuationMsg or
a NodeContinuationTopic as appropriate) on each turn on which the ConvNode is
active, <i>and</i> the player didn't address a conversational command
to the NPC on the same turn.  The second part of the condition is
important, because it means that the continuation message will only be
displayed when the player goes a turn without actively participating
in the conversation.

<p>Continuation messages can be especially useful in conversation
nodes at which the NPC has just asked a question, because you can make
it look like your NPC actually cares about getting an answer.  You can
make the continuation message keep asking the question several times
if necessary, to make it clear that your NPC expects an answer.

<p>You can use the &lt;.convnode&gt; tag within a continuation message
to switch to a new ConvNode, if you'd like.  If you don't use a
&lt;.convnode&gt; tag in a continuation message, then the current
ConvNode remains unchanged by default.  You might want to change to a
new ConvNode, for example, to make the NPC give up on getting an
answer from the player, or to make the NPC change the subject or ask a
different question.

<h3>Conversations and Agendas</h3>

<p>Back in the <a href='t3actor.htm'>first part</a> of this article,
we mentioned the "agenda" mechanism, which provides a way of giving an
NPC goals to carry out.  The agenda feature is a good way to handle
some NPC-initiated conversations.

<p>There's a subclass of AgendaItem specifically designed for
conversation initiation: ConvAgendaItem.  The special feature of
this subclass is that its isReady() method returns true only when
the NPC has not already engaged in conversation on the same turn.
This is useful because it makes the NPC wait for an "opening" in
a conversation, to avoid the appearance that the NPC is plowing
ahead with a background script regardless of a conversation
the player is attempting to conduct with the NPC.

<p>Here's an example of how we could use ConvAgendaItem to make the
NPC repeatedly request an object from the player.  The agenda item
will stay in the actor's agenda list until the player hands over the
desired object.  To avoid making the NPC overly pesky, we'll only
pursue the agenda item about 33% of the times that we could, using
a random number to decide.

<p><pre>
  bob: Person
    // ... bob's definitions ...
  ;

  + askForBook: ConvAgendaItem
    isReady = (inherited()
               &amp;&amp; rand(100) &lt; 33
               &amp;&amp; me.location == bob.location
               &amp;&amp; blackBook.isIn(me))
    isDone = (blackBook.isIn(bob))
    invokeItem()
    {
      "Bob glances at the black book.  &lt;q&gt;I'd really like to take a
      look at that book of yours,&lt;/q&gt; he says. ";
    }
  ;

  + GiveShowTopic @blackBook
    topicResponse()
    {
      "You hand Bob the book, which he takes eagerly.  He opens
      it and starts flipping through pages, like he's looking
      for something.  He stops on a page, runs his finger down
      the page.  &lt;q&gt;Now that's interesting,&lt;/q&gt; he
      says, eyes still intently on the text. &lt;q&gt;This isn't
      at all what I thought.&lt;/q&gt; He looks up at you.
      &lt;q&gt;Is it okay if I hang onto this for a while?&lt;/q&gt;
      &lt;.convnode keepBook?&gt; ";

      blackBook.moveInto(bob);
    }
  ;

  + ConvNode 'keepBook?';
  ++ YesTopic "&lt;q&gt;Sure,&lt;/q&gt; you say.
    &lt;.p&gt;&lt;q&gt;Thanks,&lt;q&gt; Bob says. &lt;q&gt;I think it'll help me tell you
    you what happened at the lighthouse.  Give me a couple of
    hours and meet me back here.&lt;/q&gt; "
  ;
  ++ NoTopic "&lt;q&gt;I'd rather you didn't keep it,&lt;/q&gt; you say.
    &lt;.p&gt;&lt;q&gt;Just give me a couple of hours,&lt;/q&gt; Bob says.
    &lt;q&gt;I'll give it back then, I promise.  I think this'll help
    me tell you what happened at the lighthouse.&lt;/q&gt; "
  ;
</pre>

<p>A stateful conversation always takes precedence over an
agenda.  If an actor has an active ConvNode, the actor will not
attempt to execute any agenda items.  An NPC will pursue its agenda
only when it has no active ConvNode object.  This ensures that the
agenda won't intrude on a conversation.


<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>As we've seen, the TADS 3 library has a number of features
designed to help you create non-player characters that do more than
just sit there and answer a few ASK ABOUT questions.  The ActorState
class helps structure the code for actors that can exhibit several
different behaviors; TopicEntry and related classes let you build a
database of knowledge for your characters, and help manage the
database as character knowledge and game conditions change;
ActorStates help give interactions
the form of real conversations; ConvNode lets you create internal
context and structure within a conversation; and SpecialTopic lets
you go beyond ASK/TELL when conversations require more nuance.

<p>All of these classes and mechanisms are a lot to take in all at
once, but don't worry that you have to learn everything here before
you can start creating NPCs.  These features are all optional, so
you can bring them to bear only when you need them, and you can add
them incrementally to your actors as you design and build your game.
The features are also designed to be modular, so you can mix and
match them as you see fit.  So, you can start with a simple, standard
Actor object, without worrying about any of this dynamic stuff; later
on, you can learn about and add dynamic features as you need them.
