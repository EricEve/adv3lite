<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Welcome to the Adv3 Version of the TADS 3 Technical Manual!

<p>This book is a collection of technical articles about different
aspects of TADS 3/Adv3Lite.  The topics here overlap somewhat with the<i>
Adv3Lite Library Manual</i>, the <i>System Manual</i>, and the <i>Library
Reference Manual</i>, but our thrust here a bit different: here, we
try to provide practical "how to" information, like a tutorial, but at
the same time to explore the details in depth, like reference
material.  Hopefully, the result is the best of both worlds rather
than the opposite.

<p>The articles here are mostly self-contained, each covering a single
topic in depth, so you can approach this material in any order you
like.  If you're just learning TADS 3/Adv3Lite, though, we recommend reading
the <a href='../t3QuickStart.htm'>Adv3Lite Quick Start Guide</a> and either
the <a href='../tutorial/index.htm '>Adv3Lite Tutorial</a> or 
<a href='../learning/LearningT3Lite.pdf'>Learning TADS 3 with Adv3Lite</a>
first - the articles in the Technical
Manual assume a degree of familiarity with the system, and these other
guides should help greatly with that.

<p>We've organized the material here into three sections.
"Fundamentals" covers the core topics that most people using TADS 3/Adv3Lite
will encounter in everyday use.  "Adv3Lite In Depth" includes material
that authors will find useful as they tackle particular
game-development challenges; read these articles as you encounter the
relevant areas in your design work.  "Advanced Topics" will be
especially useful to authors who want to really customize the system,
and should be interesting to anyone who wants to know exactly how
things work inside the library.

<p>Many of the articles here have been previously published.  Some
appeared in the Technical Articles section on <a
href='http://www.tads.org'>tads.org</a>, and some were adapted from
earlier documentation (particularly the <i>TADS 2 Author's
Manual</i>).  We've gathered them here in an effort to offer "one-stop
shopping" for TADS 3 documentation.

<p>Several of the articles herein were generously contributed by TADS
users.  Many thanks to Mike Roberts, Steve Breslin, Michel Nizette, and
Andreas Sewe for taking the time to share their expertise and for
allowing MJR to include their work in this original version of collection.
Articles not explicitly attributed to anyone else were written by Mike 
Roberts.

<p>One of the reasons for this manual's rather ad hoc organization is
that it's designed to be a living, growing collection.  It would be good to
continue adding new material over time, especially in-depth "how to"
articles.  I'm interested in hearing your ideas for new topics that
should be covered.  And if you've struggled to overcome missing
documentation to figure out for yourself how some part of the system
works, I'd be especially grateful if you'd consider contributing an
article on the subject for a future edition. A good place to offer your 
suggestions and contributions would be the TADS discussion forum on 
<a href='https://intfiction.org/c/authoring/tads'>intfiction.org</a>.

<h2>A Note on Adapting the <i>Technical Manual</i> for Adv3Lite</h2>

<p>The main challenges facing the adaptation of this Technical Manual for Adv3Lite 
have been (1) that much of its material is more closely paralleled in the 
<i>Adv3Lite Library Manual</i> than was the case for anything the original 
Technical Manual paralled, since there was no adv3 Library Manual equivalent; and (2) 
that much of the material in the original Technical Manual was specific to 
adv3 having been written and assembled before adv3Lite was ever even conceived.
The approach taken here has been to preserve as much as possible, even at the risk 
of some duplication while removing information that has no applicability to 
adv3Lite and otherwise to adapt articles originally written for adv3 to adv3Lite 
wherever feasible. Sometimes the similarities between adv3 and adv3Lite have 
made the adaptations quite straightforward; sometimes the differences have 
necessitated more extensive re-writing. In each case where I have adapted 
another author's work (and occasionally my own), I have noted the fact at 
the start of the article and provided a short note about the manner and 
the extent of the adaptation.</p>

<p>The articles not carried over from the original <i>Technical Manual</i> are:</p>
<ul>
<li>"Lists and Listers": The original version was written by me, and had I adapted it for adv3Lite it would have 
ended up simply duplicating the identically named chapter in the <a href='../manual/lister.htm'><i>Library Manual</i></a>.</li>
<li>"Banishing (and Changing) Awkward Messages": Most of the problems this article addresses don't really 
exit in adv3Lite, or at least not in the same way, and any adv3Lite-relevant material is mostly covered elsewhere.</li>
<lI>"Manipulating the Transcript": Adv3Lite doesn't use a transcript, so this article would have no relevance to 
adv3Lite.</li>
<li>"Handling odd Noun Phrases": The way the adv3Lite <a href='../manual/thing.htm#vocab'>vocab</a> property works means that the 
issues addressed in this article aren't issues for adv3Lite.</li>
<li>"Global Command Remapping": This is another feature not present in adv3Lite. The problem it is designed to solve 
in adv3 would probably be addressed in adv3Lite using <a href='../manual/doer.htm'>Doers</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>On the other hand, this edition of the <i>Technical Manual</i> adds a couple of new articles that weren't in 
the original adv3 version:</p>

<ul>
<li>"Customising (and Using) Existing Actions": This contains advice that may be helpful for any TADS 3 author but 
leans towards the adv3Lite preference for using object properties rather than modifying code wherever possible.</li>
<li>"Handling TIActions with Multi-Methods": This relates to a feature of the adv3Lite library that was new at 
the time of writing. It would seem to belong in the "advanced" category and a detailed account of it to fit the 
<i>Technical Manual</i> better than the <i>Library Manual</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Finally, the artice previously called "Where Mesages Come From" has not only been reworked for adv3Lite but 
renamed <a href='t3Messages.htm'>"Analysis of a Transcript"</a>, since this seems to me to be a slightly better indication of what it does (if any one can come up with a better name for it, do please let me know). This article gives the transcript of 
a short adv3Lite game with various parser responses linked to an explanation of where and how they are produced, which in turn link into the relevant sections of a complete listing of the adv3Lite code for game. This could be a valuable resource both for authors relatively new to TADS 3/Adv3Lite as an introduction to how the system works, and as a reference for more experienced authors interested in addressing specific problems.</p>

<p>I hope that where I have adapted other people's work, enough of their original voice and approach survives to 
give readers a valuably different perspective on material I may have covered elsewhere.</p>
