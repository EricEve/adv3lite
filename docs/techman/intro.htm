<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>Welcome to the TADS 3 Technical Manual!

<p>This book is a collection of technical articles about different
aspects of TADS 3.  The topics here overlap somewhat with <i>Getting
Started in TADS 3</i>, the <i>System Manual</i>, and the <i>Library
Reference Manual</i>, but our thrust here a bit different: here, we
try to provide practical "how to" information, like a tutorial, but at
the same time to explore the details in depth, like reference
material.  Hopefully, the result is the best of both worlds rather
than the opposite.

<p>The articles here are mostly self-contained, each covering a single
topic in depth, so you can approach this material in any order you
like.  If you're just learning TADS 3, though, we recommend reading
<i>Getting Started in TADS 3</i> first - the articles in the Technical
Manual assume a degree of familiarity with the system, and the
<i>Getting Started</i> guide should help greatly with that.

<p>We've organized the material here into three sections.
"Fundamentals" covers the core topics that most people using TADS 3
will encounter in everyday use.  "TADS 3 In Depth" includes material
that authors will find useful as they tackle particular
game-development challenges; read these articles as you encounter the
relevant areas in your design work.  "Advanced Topics" will be
especially useful to authors who want to really customize the system,
and should be interesting to anyone who wants to know exactly how
things work inside the library.

<p>Many of the articles here have been previously published.  Some
appeared in the Technical Articles section on <a
href='http://www.tads.org'>tads.org</a>, and some were adapted from
earlier documentation (particularly the <i>TADS 2 Author's
Manual</i>).  We've gathered them here in an effort to offer "one-stop
shopping" for TADS 3 documentation.

<p>Several of the articles herein were generously contributed by TADS
users.  Many thanks to Steve Breslin, Eric Eve, Michel Nizette, and
Andreas Sewe for taking the time to share their expertise and for
allowing me to include their work in this collection.

<p>One of the reasons for this manual's rather ad hoc organization is
that it's designed to be a living, growing collection.  I plan to
continue adding new material over time, especially in-depth "how to"
articles.  I'm interested in hearing your ideas for new topics that
should be covered.  And if you've struggled to overcome missing
documentation to figure out for yourself how some part of the system
works, I'd be especially grateful if you'd consider contributing an
article on the subject for a future edition.  To facilitate user
participation, I've set up a page on tads.org with a "wish list"
of new articles for future editions:
