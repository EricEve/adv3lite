<h1>NPC Travel</h1>
<h2>(Adapted for Adv3Lite by Eric Eve)</h2>
<p>Editor's Note: The adv3Lite way of handling this is sufficiently different 
from adv3 that little remains of MJR's original article here beyond the 
Introduction. The remainder is almost a complete re-write that ends up rather 
shorter.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Many IF games contain people and creatures for the player to
encounter.  These are known as non-player characters, or NPCs.  In
real life, living creatures don't tend to stay forever rooted in a
single location while the world carries on around them, so game
authors frequently want to make their NPCs move around within the
game world.

<p>If you've ever written any IF before, you know that NPCs are
inherently complicated to program, because you're trying to simulate
creatures that are incredibly complex in real life.  Fortunately, the
basics of moving your characters around within a TADS 3 game world
aren't too difficult to master.  There are a few library methods
that do most of the work for you; the only trick is to know which
ones to call in which situations.  This article covers the main
methods of moving NPCs around and describes when to use each one.


<h2>moveInto</h2>

<p>The simplest and most direct way to move actors around is with
the moveInto() method.</p>

<p>moveInto() is a method of the actor you want to move,
and you call it with the new location as the parameter:

<p><pre>
   bob.moveInto(iceCave);
</pre>

<p>You should use moveInto() when you want to move an actor
"by fiat" - that is, you want complete programmatic control over what
happens, and what side effects occur.  This routine simply makes the
actor disappear from the old location and magically reappear in the
new location.  The library doesn't attempt to simulate the travel when
you use this routine: there's no attempt to open any doors along the
way, for example, and the library doesn't generate any messages
mentioning that the actor is departing or arriving.

<h2>actionMoveInto</h2>
<p>The difference between actionMoveInto() and moveInto() is that 
actionMoveInto also calls the notifyRemove and notifyInsert methods 
on the locations being moved from and to, marks the object (here the 
npc) as being moved, and marks it as having been seen by the player 
character if the player character can see it in its new location. 
You may or may not want these additional side-effects. If you do,
use actionMoveInto(), otherwise use moveInto().</p>


<h2>travelVia</h2>

<p>The travelVia() method performs more "simulated" travel than
moveInto or actionMoveInto do. Unlike
moveInto(), the travelVia() method <i>does</i> carry out all
of the standard notifications involved in the travel: it calls
beforeTravel() on everything nearby in the starting location; it calls
 it calls travelerLeaving() on the starting location, which displays a departure
message if the player character can see the actor departing; it calls
noteTraversal() on the TravelConnector; it calls travelerEntering() on
the new location;  and it calls afterTravel() on
everything nearby in the new location.

<p>travelVia(<i>conn</i>. <i>announceArrival?</i>) is
 a method of the actor who's traveling, 
where <i>conn</i> is the connector being
traversed, and <i>announceArrival?</i> (which defaults to true) is 
a flag that determines whether or not to display a message 
about the actor's arrival in the new location if the actor 
can be seen there by the player character.</p>

  Here's an example:

<p><pre>
   local conn = bob.location.east;
   bob.travelVia(conn);
</pre>

<p>Note that travelVia() checks any travel barries that are 
in force on the connector, and do typically does carry out any pre-conditions
of the travel.  For example, if a closed door is in the way,
travelVia() will make the character attempt to open it, and travel 
will be interrupted if it's locked.  This is a plus and a minus, depending on what
you're trying to accomplish; it's less useful when you want to move your
characters by fiat, without regard to the simulation implications,
help avoid creating jarring, unrealistic
effects for the player.

<h2>Travel with Pathfinding</h2>
<p>The most full-featured travel method is the one that uses
adv3Lite library's contains a pathfinding module. This enables
you to calculate the shortest route from one location to another,
such as npc's current location to where you'd like them to move 
to. You could use this to script a quasi-automous npc who moves 
around the map in a realistic manner.</p>

<p>To use route finding to implement NPC travel, you'd need to 
do first things: first use the <a name='../manual/pathfind.htm#routefinder'>routefinder</a>
to calculate the route, like this:<p>
<p><pre>
  routeFinder.findPath(bob.getOutermostRoom, <i>destinationRoom</i>);
</pre> 

<p>Then use this information to move the npc along the route, using code 
like that auggested in the Library Manual's section on the routeFinder (see link 
above) or by using using travelVia(), e.g.:
<p><pre>
   local dir;
   local idx = routeFinder.cachedPath.indexWhich({x: x[2] == bob.getOutermostRoom});
   if(idx != nil &amp;&amp; idx &lt; routeFinder.cachedPath.length)
      dir = routeFinder.cachedPath[idx + 1][1];
   
   if(dir)
   {
      local conn = bob.getOutermostRoom.getConnector(dir);
      if(conn)
         bob.travelVia(conn);
   }         
;   
</pre>

<p>In turn, you might put this code (or a suitable adapted vesion of it) 
in the invokeItem() method of an <a href='../manual/agenda.htm'>AgendaItem</a> that remains 
active until Bob reaches his destination.</p>

<h2>Choosing a Method</h2>

<p>The four main NPC travel methods - routefinder, travelVia(),
and moveInto() and actionMoveInto() - all have their uses.  Which one you use
depends on the situation, and you'll probably use more than one in
any given game.

<p>You should use moveInto() when you want to move an actor
"by fiat," without triggering any simulation side effects.  This is
the one to use when you want complete control over what happens, and
are willing to take complete responsibility for things like generating
arrival and departure messages. This or actionMoveInto() are probably 
the best options when, for example, the player character's arrival
in a location triggers the npc's arrival in the same location from 
a different direction, or you want to move the npc off-stage from 
the player character's location.

<p>Use actionMoveInto() when you want to trigger a minimal subset 
of the notifications normally associated with travel, but you still want control over the NPC's
actions during the travel.  In particular, this method doesn't trigger
any preconditions of the travel, so it's up to you to make sure that
any doors that need to be open are open, for example (or else indicate to 
the player that the npc has opened and close any doors that would  
need to have been opened and closed).

<p>Use travelVia() when you know (or can easily figure out) 
which TravelConnector you want the actor to use,
and you want the library make the npc use it.
This method is best when you want the NPC's travel
to be fully simulated, triggering all of the same preconditions and
side effects that the player would trigger with a normal "go east"
command or the like. This might be the best way to go, if, for example,
there might be some barrier, such as a locked door, that would prevent 
the npc reaching its intended destination.

<p>Use routeFinder when you need your npc to appear to be a quasi-autonomous
actor going about their own business regardless of what the player character 
is doing, so that the player character may or may not encounter the npc 
travelling along their route (and the npc may or may not react to the 
player character if their paths happen to cross).
