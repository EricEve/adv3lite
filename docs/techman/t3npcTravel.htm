<h1>NPC Travel</h1>
<h2>(Adapted for Adv3Lite by Eric Eve)</h2>
<p>Editor's Note: The adv3Lite way of handling this is sufficiently different 
from adv3 that little remains of MJR's original article here beyond the 
Introduction. The remainder is almost a complete re-write that ends up rather 
shorter.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Many IF games contain people and creatures for the player to
encounter.  These are known as non-player characters, or NPCs.  In
real life, living creatures don't tend to stay forever rooted in a
single location while the world carries on around them, so game
authors frequently want to make their NPCs move around within the
game world.

<p>If you've ever written any IF before, you know that NPCs are
inherently complicated to program, because you're trying to simulate
creatures that are incredibly complex in real life.  Fortunately, the
basics of moving your characters around within a TADS 3 game world
aren't too difficult to master.  There are a few library methods
that do most of the work for you; the only trick is to know which
ones to call in which situations.  This article covers the main
methods of moving NPCs around and describes when to use each one.


<h2>moveInto</h2>

<p>The simplest and most direct way to move actors around is with
the moveInto() method.</p>

<p>moveInto() is a method of the actor you want to move,
and you call it with the new location as the parameter:

<p><pre>
   bob.moveInto(iceCave);
</pre>

<p>You should use moveInto() when you want to move an actor
"by fiat" - that is, you want complete programmatic control over what
happens, and what side effects occur.  This routine simply makes the
actor disappear from the old location and magically reappear in the
new location.  The library doesn't attempt to simulate the travel when
you use this routine: there's no attempt to open any doors along the
way, for example, and the library doesn't generate any messages
mentioning that the actor is departing or arriving.

<h2>actionMoveInto</h2>
<p>The difference between actionMoveInto() and moveInto() is that 
actionMoveInto also calls the notifyRemove and notifyInsert methods 
on the locations being moved from and to, marks the object (here the 
npc) as being moved, and marks it as having been seen by the player 
character if the player character can see it in its new location. 
You may or may not want these additional side-effects. If you do,
use actionMoveInto(), otherwise use moveInto().</p>


<h2>travelVia</h2>

<p>The travelVia() method performs more "simulated" travel than
moveInto or actionMoveInto do. Unlike
moveInto(), the travelVia() method <i>does</i> carry out all
of the standard notifications involved in the travel: it calls
beforeTravel() on everything nearby in the starting location; it calls
 it calls travelerLeaving() on the starting location, which displays a departure
message if the player character can see the actor departing; it calls
noteTraversal() on the TravelConnector; it calls travelerEntering() on
the new location;  and it calls afterTravel() on
everything nearby in the new location.

<p>travelVia(<i>conn</i>. <i>announceArrival?</i>) is
 a method of the actor who's traveling, 
where <i>conn</i> is the connector being
traversed, and <i>announceArrival?</i> (which defaults to true) is 
a flag that determines whether or not to display a message 
about the actor's arrival in the new location if the actor 
can be seen there by the player character.</p>

  Here's an example:

<p><pre>
   local conn = bob.location.east;
   bob.travelVia(conn);
</pre>

<p>Note that travelVia() checks any travel barries that are 
in force on the connector, and do typically does carry out any pre-conditions
of the travel.  For example, if a closed door is in the way,
travelVia() will make the character attempt to open it, and travel 
will be interrupted if it's locked.  This is a plus and a minus, depending on what
you're trying to accomplish; it's less useful when you want to move your
characters by fiat, without regard to the simulation implications,
help avoid creating jarring, unrealistic
effects for the player.

<h2 id="scripted">Travel with Pathfinding - scriptedTravelTo()</h2>
<p>The most full-featured travel method is the one that can use
adv3Lite library's pathfinding module. This enables
you to calculate the shortest route from one location to another,
such as npc's current location to where you'd like them to move 
to. You could use this to script a quasi-automous npc who moves 
around the map in a realistic manner.</p>

<p>To initiate scripted travel of this sort, we just call 
scriptedTravelTo(dest) on the actor, e.g., 
<code>bob.scriptedTravelTo(lighthouse)</code>. Alternatively
we can define the path we want the actor to follow for ourselves.
The </i>dest</i> parameter can be one of:</p>
<ul>
<li>A Room or Thing, in which case the route to that Room or Thing will be calculated for the actor to follow.</li>
     
<li>A list of travel connectors (which can include Rooms) for the actor to follow from its
     current location. It's the game author's responsibility to ensure this makes sense. Where
     connections between rooms on the map aare via some other form of travel connector it may be
     better to list that connector rather than the room it leads to in order to ensure any
     side-effects of travel or travel barriers are respected, but there may be legitimate
     reasons for bypassing these and simply listing the Room to be traveled to.</li>
     
<li>A list in the same format as that generated by the route finder, [[nil, currentRoom],
[dir, nextroom], [dir, nextroom]..., e.g. [[nil, hall], [eastDir, kitchen], [downDir,
cellar]] ]  The first element of this list must specify the actor's current room. This way of
specifying a route is probably less convenient for game authors but is available since it's
used by the routeFinder.</li>
     
<li>Any other kind of value, such as nil, to reset the actor's route (and so stop the
     scripted travel).</li>
</ul>

<p>Once scripted travel has been initiated by <code>scriptedTravelTo</code> the actor's <code>takeTurn()</code>
method will call <code>tryScriptedTravel()</code> on the actor once each turn to make the actor take the next 
step along the route, unless any of the following take precedence:</p>

<ol>
<li>The actor has conversed (with the player character) on the same turn (either by a NodeContinuation or because 
the player had directed a conversational command to the actor on that turn.</i>
<li>The actor had executed an AgendaItem on the same turn.</li>
<li>The actor's canEndConversation(endConvActor) method returns nil, which may, for example,
be the case if <code>sayBlockBye</code> is defined on an active ConvNode or NodeEndCheck to prevent 
the actor wandering off at such a point in the conversation.</li>
</ol>

<p>This behaviour is probably what we want most of the time. It allows us to interrupt 
the actor's scripted travel either by the player character conversing with the actor,
if they happen to meet on the way, or by an AgendaItem that allows us to have the actor
do something else along the route, or maybe stop travelling or setting out in a different 
direction if and when particular conditions obtain.</p>

<p>There may be some occasions when this isn't what we want, however. The most likely
is when we set up scripted travel by calling <code>getActor.scriptedTravelTo()</code> from the 
invokeItem() method of an <b>AgendaItem</b> as we often might. Since <code>tryScriptedTravel()</code> 
won't be called on the same turn as an AgendaItem has been executed for the same actor,
the actor won't start moving until the following turn. If that's not what we want,
we could get round it by calling <code>tryScriptedTravel()</code> manually, but we can 
instead call scriptedTravelTo() with its second, optional, parameter set to true, 
e.g.,:

<p><pre>
bobTravelToLighthouseAgenda: AgendaItem
   invokeItem()
   {
       getActor.scriptedTravelTo(lighthouse, true);
       isDone = true;
   }
   ...
;
</pre></p>

<p>This will force bob to start moving on the same turn. The other places we may need to do this are 
in the whenStarting(), whenEnding(), or eachTurn() method of a Scene (since these are called on Scenes
after the takeTurn() methods of actors).</p>

<p>An actor's scripted travel will stop altogether (rather than just pause and resume) under any
of the following three conditions:</p>
<ul>
<li>The actor reaches its destination (so if we wanted to use scriptedTravelTo to send an actor 
in a continuous loop we'd need to restart the loop every time the actor reached its destination).</li>
<li>Through an explicit call to <code>scriptedTravel(nil)</code> on the actor.</li>
<li>The actor attempts scripted travel but fails to move to a new room. This could be because 
a locked door or a travel barrier intervenes, or because a beforeAction() or beforeTravel() method 
intervenes to veto travel.</li>
</ul>

<p>As noted above, the <i>dest</i> parameter of scriptedTravelTo(dest) can be a Thing as well
as a Room, in which case the actor will set out for the Room that contains the <i>dest</i> 
object. It does not, however, check whether the <i>dest</i> object subsequently moves,
as it might if it's another actor, the player character, or an object being carried by another 
actor or the player character. If we want to endow our actor with tracking skills to follow 
such a moving target, we'd need to find a way to reissue the scriptedTravelTo() call each time 
the target object moves. One way to do this might be to use a Scene:</p>

<p><pre>
pursuitScene:Scene
   startsWhen = (whatever)
   
   whenStarting()
   {
      bob.scriptedTravelTo(gPlayerChar, true);
   }
   
   oldPcLoc = nil
   
   beforeAction
   {
      <i>/*Note the player character's location*/</i>
      oldPcLoc = gRoom;
   }
   
   afterAction()
   {
       if(gRoom != oldPcLoc)
          scriptedTravelTo(gRoom);
   }
   
   endsWhen = bob.isIn(gRoom)
   
   whenEnding()
   {
      bob.scriptedTravelTo(nil);
      ... 
      <i>/* e.g. if we want bob to start following the player character from here. */</i>
      bob.startFollowing();
   }

</pre></p>

<p>If we want Bob to keep following the player character once he's caught up with  
them, we need to use the method described in the next section; scriptedTravelTo() is 
intended for actor's moving around independently of the player character rather than 
for accompanying travel.</p>

<h2>Accompanying and Following</h2>
<p>Accompanying travel is where one actor accompanies another (usually the player 
character) on their travels, typically as a sidekick or guide. This requires rather
different treatment from the methods discussed above.</p>

<p>If we want an NPC to follow the player character around as an accompanying actor,
we simply call the NPC's <b>startFollowing()</b> method. To subsequently stop the 
actor following the player character around we call its <b>stopFollowing</b> method.</p>

<p>If the actor wants the player character to follow him/her/them around, we need to a 
<a href='../manual/agenda.htm#followagenda'>FollowAgendaItem</a> for the actor, then
define its <strong>connectorList</strong> property, which is a list of connectors (which in the simplest case could just be rooms, but might need to include doors, stairways and other TravelConnectors) through which the actor wishes to lead the player character. We can optionally also override the <strong>specialDesc</strong> method to provide a description of where the actor wants to lead the player character, and an <strong>arrivingDesc</strong> method to describe the leading actor arriving in a new destination having just led the player character there.</p>

<h2>Choosing a Method</h2>

<p>The six main NPC travel methods - startFollowing(), FollowAgendaItem,
 scriptedTravelTo(), travelVia(), moveInto() and actionMoveInto() - all have their uses.  
 Which one you usedepends on the situation, and you'll probably use more than one in
any given game.

<p>You should use moveInto() when you want to move an actor
"by fiat," without triggering any simulation side effects.  This is
the one to use when you want complete control over what happens, and
are willing to take complete responsibility for things like generating
arrival and departure messages. This or actionMoveInto() are probably 
the best options when, for example, the player character's arrival
in a location triggers the npc's arrival in the same location from 
a different direction, or you want to move the npc off-stage from 
the player character's location.

<p>Use actionMoveInto() when you want to trigger a minimal subset 
of the notifications normally associated with travel, but you still want control over the NPC's
actions during the travel.  In particular, this method doesn't trigger
any preconditions of the travel, so it's up to you to make sure that
any doors that need to be open are open, for example (or else indicate to 
the player that the npc has opened and close any doors that would  
need to have been opened and closed).

<p>Use travelVia() when you know (or can easily figure out) 
which TravelConnector you want the actor to use,
and you want the library make the npc use it.
This method is best when you want the NPC's travel
to be fully simulated, triggering all of the same preconditions and
side effects that the player would trigger with a normal "go east"
command or the like. This might be the best way to go, if, for example,
there might be some barrier, such as a locked door, that would prevent 
the npc reaching its intended destination.

<p>Use scriptedTravelTo() when you need your npc to appear to be a quasi-autonomous
actor going about their own business regardless of what the player character 
is doing, so that the player character may or may not encounter the npc 
travelling along their route (and the npc may or may not react to the 
player character if their paths happen to cross).

<p>Use startFollowing() when you want your npc to act as a sidekick character
accompanying the player character on their travels.

<p>Finally, use a FollowAgendaItem when you an npc to lead (or perhaps compel)
the player charactert to accompany them.
