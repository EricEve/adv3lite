<h1>Tips: A Context-Sensitive Help System</h1>
<p><i>by Krister Fundin</i>
<h2>Adapted for adv3Lite by Eric Eve</h2>
<p>Editor's Note: the adaptation required to the original text here is minimal,
since I implemented an adv3Lite version of Tips to match Kristed Fundin's
description of its use in this article.</p>

<p>The Tips system is quite similar to the <a href='../manual/hint.htm#extra'>Extra Hints</a>
facility provided in the adv3Lite library, but does serve a subtly different function and
works in a slightly different way. For one thing, the Tips system will be present even
in games that don't use hints and choose to exclude hints.t from their project. For another,
Extra Hints are primarily designed to help new players with a specific game, whereas
Tips are geared towards guiding players about IF features in general.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>There are several well-known ways of making a work of interactive
fiction more accessible to inexperienced players. Some sort of
built-in getting-started text or player's guide is one way, though far
from everyone will bother reading these. Another approach is to
provide pointers interactively during play, by responding
intelligently to different kinds of errors and informing the player
about commands as they become relevant.  TADS 3 already does this for
a few of the standard system commands, for instance mentioning the
NOTIFY OFF command the first time a score notification is shown. 
This article explains how to add new, custom tips of your own
to supplement the standard system tips.

<p>The Tips system (originally written as an extension, but
integrated with the standard library as of version 3.0.17 and now 
incorporated into adv3Lite) is a simple
framework for creating your own custom tips.  The system provides an
easy way to define a custom tip message and trigger its display, and
takes care of the book-keeping needed to ensure that each tip is
displayed only once.  The system also includes a command to turn all
tips off, and this mode can be saved as a global default, across all
stories; experienced players who don't want to be bothered with the
standard litany of tips in each new game they play can use this to
suppress them across the board.

<h2>Basic usage</h2>

<p>Let's continue with a practical example.  This example is
actually defined in the library already, so you don't have to copy
any of this into your game, but it's a good illustration of how
to use the system.

<p>Many IF stories contain some places where the player can screw up
in an immediately obvious way: accidentally breaking or losing an
important object, getting locked out of a building, etc.  Experienced
players know that they can always "take back" a command that does
something like this by typing UNDO.  A novice player might not know
that it's so easy to get out of the bind, though, so this looks like a
great place for a tip.

<p>To define the tip, you create a Tip object, and provide its message
text.  Defining the Tip object is pretty easy using the template:

<p>
<p><div class="code"><pre>
undoTip: Tip
   "If this didn't turn out quite as intended, note that you can
   always take back one or more commands by typing
   &lt;&lt;aHref('undo', 'UNDO', 'Take back the most recent command')&gt;&gt;."
;
</pre></div>

<p>(Remember, the library defines this object already - we're just
using it as an example, so you don't need to add this to your own
game.)  The "aHref" part creates a hyperlink that lets the user
enter the UNDO command by clicking on the link.  This is by no means
necessary, but it's a nice touch. 

<p>Having defined the Tip object, we can trigger the tip message
wherever it's appropriate simply by calling:

<p>
<p><div class="code"><pre>
undoTip.showTip();
</pre></div>

<h2>Avoiding redundancy</h2>

<p>One thing that we should be aware of before we start adding
thousands of tips to our ever so newbie-friendly work, is that for
every tip we display, we might be telling the player something she
already knows. This is why a tip is only shown once by default. In
addition to this, though, it's generally a good idea to pre-emptively
cancel a tip if the player does something to indicate that she
wouldn't need it. This can be done by calling the makeShown() method
on the relevant tip.

<p>In the above example, it would be redundant to show a tip about the
UNDO command if the player had actually typed UNDO already in the
course of the game.  The player obviously must know about the command
if she typed it in, so she presumably doesn't need to hear about it in
a tip.  So, we'd add a line like this somewhere in the Undo action
handler:

<p>
<p><div class="code"><pre>
undoTip.makeShown();
</pre></div>

<p>The library does just this within the Undo action's execAction()
handler, so you don't have to enter this yourself anywhere for this
particular example.  For new custom tips you create, you should
consider adding something along the same lines to the appropriate
action.  For example, if you were to create a tip to explain the
CONSULT command when the player first encounters an encyclopedia
within the game, you could do something like this:

<p><div class="code"><pre>
modify ConsultAboutAction
   beforeAction()
   {
      inherited();
      consultTip.makeShown();
   }
</pre></div>


<h2>Turning tips on and off</h2>

<p>Not everyone will need tips, obviously, so the Tips system provides
a command for turning them on and off (TIPS ON and TIPS OFF).
 A way to further save the veteran player from having to deal with
all this is to ask whether to show any tips before starting a new
session. The question doesn't have to be phrased this way, though. We
could simply ask something like "Are you familiar with interactive
fiction?" Then again, even that question could be unnecessary. If the
default settings indicate that the tips have already been turned off
at some earlier point, then it's probably best to just leave them off.
We can test or change this setting by referring to the tipMode.isOn
property.

<p>Finally, there are some tips that you'll probably want to show even
when the player has turned off tips in general. If a particular tip
explains some feature that's unique to a particular story or an
extension that it uses, even an experienced player would probably want
to see that one.  We can achieve this by overriding the
shouldShowTip() method of a tip object so that it only checks the
isShown property and not the tipMode:

<p><div class="code"><pre>
mySpecialTip: Tip
   "In this particular story, etc."

   shouldShowTip()
   {
       return (isShown == nil);
   }
;
</pre></div>


<h2>Tip display style</h2>

<p>The pre-defined Tips have their own <span class="code">&lt;.tip&gt;</span> style tag. The text of a
tip will always be wrapped in a pair of these, so that we can alter the way
in which tips are displayed. This can be done by modifying or replacing the
tipStyleTag object, which by default just puts a pair of parentheses around
the text.

<p>On HTML interpreters, some nice-looking styles can be achived,
though we shouldn't get too carried away. The author of the Tips
system is quite fond of the following style:

<p><div class="code"><pre>
replace tipStyleTag: HtmlStyleTag 'tip'
   htmlOpenText =
       '&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;font size=-1 color=WHITE
       bgcolor=BLUE&gt;&amp;nbsp;TIP:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&amp;nbsp;'
   htmlCloseText = '&lt;/blockquote&gt;'

   plainOpenText = '('
   plainCloseText = ')'
;
</pre></div>

<p>If we wanted something completely different, like showing all tips in a
separate banner, then we could modify the Tip class and override the
showTipDesc() property, perhaps to something like this:

<p><div class="code"><pre>
modify Tip
   showTipDesc()
   {
       tipBanner.clearBanner();

       tipBanner.captureOutput({: desc() });
   }
;
</pre></div>
