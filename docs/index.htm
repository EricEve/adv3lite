an explanation of the other documentation, including guidance on where to go
next, and a sample game newcomers can experiment with if they want to dive
straight it.</p>

Adv3Lite Tutorial
</a>
<br>by Eric Eve

<p>This tutorial introduction is a great starting point for anyone new
to TADS 3 and new to programming.  The book opens with the basics of
getting TADS working on your system and setting up your first simple
game, so even if you've never done any programming before, this will
help you get going quickly.  The tutorial then leads you step by step
through the design of three example games, showing how to use
adv3Lite to implement the effects needed in the game.  By the time you're
done, you'll know your way around the system and you'll be able to
write your own games.
