<h1>Scope</h1>

<a name="objscope"></a><h2>Object Scope and Topic Scope</h2>

<p>Scope denotes the set of objects that are available to be the target of a command, or to react to any actions that are carried out in the course of executing that command. The two most common kinds of scope for commands in Interactive Fiction are <em>object scope</em> and <em>topic scope</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Object scope</strong> denotes the set of objects in the game world that the player character (or some other actor) can physically interact with (at least through one of the senses, not necessarily touch) at a particular point in time. Roughly speaking object scope normally thus comprises the set of objects that are both in the same physical location as the actor (i.e. within the same top-level Room) and visible to the player (i.e. not enclosed in an opaque closed container). In a darkened room scope is generally restricted to the actor, the actor's contents (anything carried by the actor) and objects that are visible in the dark (i.e. for which visibleInDark is true). The set of objects in physical scope for an actor can be obtained by calling the method Q.scopeList(actor).toList().</p>

<p><strong>Topic scope</strong> denotes the set of objects (Things and/or Topics) that can match the topicDobj or topicIobj token in a VerbRule, in other words the set of objects the player character can refer to without necessarily interacting with. By default this is the subset of all Things and Topics defined in the game that are known to the player character (i.e. for which obj.known is true or, equivalently, gPlayerChar.knowsAbout(obj) is true). The list of objects in topic scope for the player character can be obtained by calling the method Q.topicScope().</p>

<p>A third type of scope, universal scope, can sometimes be useful for <a href="debug.htm">debugging commands</a> that need to be able to refer to any object in the game world regardless of whether the normal world model would allow the player character to interact with them. If you need to add debugging commands in your own game you can get a universal scope list either by calling the makeScopeUniversal() method on your action, or by using <span class="code">World.universalScope</span> (for all Things and Topics) or <span class="code">World.universalScope.subset({o: o.ofKind(Thing)})</span> if, as is more likely, you just want a list of every Thing in the game. Universal scope may also be useful for some non-debugging commands such as GO TO that can refer to objects that aren't immediately present, although such commands may prefer to use a fourth kind of scope, known scope, which only includes the Things (but not the Topics) known to the player character. This can be obtained from Q.knownScopeList().</p>

<a name="changing"></a><h2>Changing the Definition of Scope</h2>

<p>Most of the time the library default definitions of scope will do what you need, but if you do need to use something different (e.g. to add additional items to scope when the player character is in a dark room, or to allow objects to be viewed or listened to when they're in a remote location), there are several techniques available.</p>


<p>First, you could amend the library's default definition of Scope by defining a <a href="query.htm#special">Special</a> object that's active when you need it. This allows you to change what is returned by Q.scopeList(actor) or Q.topicScope.</p>

<p>Second, you could override the addExtraScopeItems(role) method on the current action (where role is either DirectObject or IndirectObject) to place additional items in scope for the action in question. For a debugging action, for example, you might make this method call <span class="code">makeScopeUniversal()</span> to put every game object in scope.</p>

<p>Third, you could override addExtraScopeItems(action) on the current Room (where <em>action</em> is the current action). Note that this is what Action.addExtraScopeItems(role) does by default, so if you override the addExtraScopeItems() method on the action, addExtraScopeItems() might not work on the Room or Region unless you remember to call the inherited handling.</p>

<p>Fourth, you could list the additional items to be placed in scope in the extraScopeItems property of the enclosing Room or Region(s). Note that this will only work if you have not overridden the addExtraScopeItems() method of the Rooms and/or Regions in question to do something different.</p>

<p>Fifth, you could override the addExtraScopeItems(action) method on the Region.</p>

<p>Sixth (and probably most trickily), you could override the buildScopeList(role) method on the action to define some totally different way of defining scope for that particular action.</p>

<p>For a more extended discussion of changing the definition of scope for particular actions or situations, see the article on <a href='../techman/t3scope.htm'>Redefining Scope</a> in the <i>Technical Manual</i>.
