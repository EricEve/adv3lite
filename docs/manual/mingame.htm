<a name="mingamedef"></a><h1>Starting Out &mdash; A Minimal Game Definition</h1>
<p>The minimal game in adv3Lite is very similar to that in adv3. At the basic minimum it must contain a <a href="beginning.htm#gamemain">gameMain</a> object defining the initial player character, the object defining the player character, and the player character's starting location. In adv3Lite the initial player character shoud be of class Player. You must also remember to include the library header. An absolutely minimal adv3Lite game might therefore look like this:</p>


<p><div class="code"><pre>
#charset "us-ascii"
#include "advlite.h"

gameMain: GameMainDef    
;

startLoc: Room 'Starting Location'
   "This is the featureless starting location. "
;

+ me: Player 'you'
;

</pre></div> 

<p>In practice, any real game would want also to include a <a href="beginning.htm#versioninfo">versionInfo</a> object to provide information about the game, and at the very least a showIntro() method on gameMain to display an introduction to the game, as well as some description of the player character and a more fully-implemented starting location. The actual starting code for a real game might therefore look more like this:</p>

<p><div class="code"><pre>
#charset "us-ascii"
#include "advlite.h"

versionInfo: GameID

    version = '1'
    authorEmail = 'Eric Eve &lt;eric.eve@hmc.ox.ac.uk&gt;'
    desc = 'A test game for the advlite library.'

    showAbout()
    {
        "This is a demonstration/test game for the advlite library. It should
        be possible to reach a winning solution using a basic subset of common
        IF commands.&lt;.p&gt;";
    }
    
    showCredit()
    {
        "adv3Lite libary by Eric Eve with substantial chunks borrowed from the
        Mercury and adv3 libraries by Mike Roberts. ";

    showIntro()
    {       
        cls();
               
        "&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color='red'&gt;FIRE!&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;  You woke up just now, choking
            from the smoke that was already starting to fill your bedroom,
            threw something on and hurried downstairs -- narrowly missing
            tripping over the beach ball so thoughtgfully left on the landing
            by your &lt;i&gt;dear&lt;/i&gt; nephew Jason -- you &lt;i&gt;knew&lt;/i&gt; having him to
            stay yesterday would be trouble -- perhaps he's even responsible
            for the fire (not that he's around any more to blame -- that's one
            less thing to worry about anyway).\b
            So, here you are, in the hall, all ready to dash out of the house
            before it burns down around you. There's just one problem: in your
            hurry to get downstairs you left your front door key in your
            bedroom.&lt;.p&gt;";

    "&lt;&lt;one of&gt;&gt;At least the fire hasn't reached the ground floor yet. The hall
    is still blessedly clear of smoke, though you can see the smoke billowing
    around at the top of the stairs you've just come down. The front door
    leading out to the safety of the drive is just a few paces to the west -- if
    only you'd remembered that key! Otherwise all seems normal: \v&lt;&lt;or&gt;&gt;At a
    less troubled time you'd feel quite proud of this hall. A fine oak staircase
    sweeps up to the floor above, matching the solid front door that stands just
    to the west. &lt;&lt;stopping&gt;&gt;The pictures you bought last year look totally
    oblivious of the flames that might engulf them, and since so far the fire
    seems confined to the top floor there's nothing blocking your path north to
    the lounge, east to the kitchen, or south to the study.  "

<p>Don't worry if not all of this code makes sense to you yet. It will all be explained in due course (not least what to authors used to the adv3 library will look like a rather strange template definition on the me object). Of course the above code will not compile and work property until the study, lounge, kitchen and landing rooms have been implemented along with the front door, but that's a separate exercise. If you want to try to compile and run the above code you will need to first comment out all the direction property definitions on the hall object, i.e. all the lines from <span class=code>south = study</span> to <span class=code>out asExit(west)</span>. You will also need to ensure that the adv3Lite library is properly included and configured in your project, which is what we shall briefly discuss next.</p>

<p>

<h2><a name="including_idx">Including the adv3Lite library</a></h2>
<p>To make your adv3Lite game work properly, you obviously need to compile it with the adv3Lite library.</p>
<p>To do this in Workbench, first make sure you have TADS 3.1.3 or above. Then ensure that you have installed the adv3 library folder under your extensions folder (or some other folder that Workbench is set to search for extensions or libraries). The first time you use adv3Lite, select Tools -&gt; Options from the Workbench menu. Scroll down to the System -&gt; Library Paths section of the dialog box that should then appear. Add the full path to the directory where you installed adv3Lite (e.g. C:\Users\Eric\Documents\TADS 3\extensions\adv3Lite) to the list (click the Add Folder button and navigate to the folder you want and then select it). If you have just installed adv3Lite you may need to close Workbench (if it's open) and open it again before creating your first adv3Lite project. Then use Workbench's New Project wizard in the normal way (Select New Project from the File menu and fill in the dialogs that follow) and select adv3Lite from the list of project types that should now be available (it will be listed after the built-in TADS 3 project types).</p>

<p>If you're not using Workbench but you're instead compiling from the command line, proceed as you would for an adv3 game (see the section on <a href='../sysman/build.htm'>Compiling and Linking</a> in the <i>TADS 3 System Manual</i> if you need guidance on this, and/or consult the article on <a href='../techman/t3start.htm'>Creating Your First TADS 3 Project</a> in the <i>TADS 3 Technical Manual</i>
), but specify the adv3Lite library instead (<span class=code> -lib adv3Lite</span>) and include the option <span class=code> -D LANGUAGE = english</span> on the command line.</p>

<h2>An Alternative Way to Set Up a New Game</h2>
<p>If you don't want to go through all the steps listed above to create a new adv3Lite game outside Workbench (or if you don't have TADS 3.1.3 or above), here is another way:</p>
<ol>
<li>Under the directory in which you keep your own TADS 3 game source files (on a Windows System this might be My Documents\TADS 3, for example) create a new directory (or folder) for your project, giving it an appropriate name (related to the name of the game you intend to write).</li>
<li>Locate the template folder within the adv3Lite folder (the folder containing the adv3Lite library).</li>
<li>Copy (don't move) the entire contents of the template folder to the new folder you created in step 1.</li>
<li>In the new folder, rename the files adv3Ltemplate.t3m and adv3Ltemplate.tdbconfig to something more appropriate to your game, such as myGame.t3m and myGame.tdbconfig (use your own game name in place of myGame, but make sure you use the same name for both files).</li>
<li>You can if you like rename start.t to something more appropriate such as myGame.t, but that will create additional complications later on, so you might want to skip that step if you're not confident about dealing with the consequences.</li>
<li>Open the file myGame.t3m in Workbench (if you're not using Workbench you'll have to edit it by hand instead).</li>
<li>In Workbench, open the Build->Settings dialogue (from the menu), click the Output tab and then change the name of the three compiled output files from adv3template.xxx to something more appropriate to your game (such as myGame.t3 and myGame.exe). If you aren't using Workbench you may need to edit myGame.t3m (or whatever you called it) by hand to add a -o mygame.t3 option (or whatever you want to call your game).</li>
<li>If you renamed start.t to something else at an earlier step (mygame.t, for example), then in Workbench you'll need to right click on start.t in the Source Files pane on the left-hand side of the screen and select the "Remove start.t from Project" option; then you'll need to right click on "Source Files" in the left-hand pane, select  "Add file..." and select the renamed file (e.g. mygame.t). Then you'll need to drag it down to the bottom of the list and double-click on it to open it in the editor. If you're not using Workbench you'll need to edit myGame.t3m (or whatever you called it) in a text editor and change the final line, - source start, to - source mygame (or whatever your filename is).</li>
<li>You should now be good to go, but if you experience any problems it may be because Workbench doesn't know where to find the library files. In that case select Tools -> Options and navigate to the System -> Library Paths tab and add the location where you've put adv3Lite (on my system it's C:\Users\Eric\Documents\TADS 3\extensions\adv3Lite; on yours it will be something different). </li>
</ol>
