<h1>Hints</h1>

<h2>Standard Hints</h2>
<p>The hintsys.t module can be used to implement a built-in hint system for your game. If you don't want any built-in hints in your game, exclude hintsys.t from your build. If you do include hintsys.t you must also include menusys.t.</p>

<p>The hintsys module in advLite is almost identical to that in adv3, except that what adv3 calls the openWhenDescribed and closeWhenDescribed properties of Goal are called openWhenExamined and closeWhenExamined in adv3Lite, and adv3Lite additionally defines openWhenMoved and closeWhenMoved.</p>

<p>To build a hint system with the hintsys.t module, you must start by defining a <b>TopHintMenu</b> item, which can be an anonymous object. The hintManager will automatically register the TopHintMenu item with the library so that a HINTS command can make use of it. Depending on how many hints you're likely to need to show at once, you can either put <b>Goal</b> objects directly under the TopHintMenu (a Goal object describes a current objective the player may be trying to achieve) or create a sub-menu structure using <b>HintMenu</b> items; for example:</p>

<p><div class=code><pre>
 topHintMenu: TopHintMenu 'Hints';
   + HintMenu 'General Questions';
   ++ Goal 'What am I supposed to be doing?' [answer, answer, answer];
   ++ Goal 'Amusing things to try' [thing, thing, thing];
   + HintMenu 'First Area';
   ++ Goal 'How do I get past the shark?' [answer, answer, answer];
   ++ Goal 'How do I open the fish tank?' [answer, answer, answer];
   + HintMenu 'Second Area';
   ++ Goal 'Where is the gold key?' [answer, answer, answer];
   ++ Goal 'How do I unlock the gold door?' [answer, answer, answer];  
</pre></div>

<p>Note that there's no requirement that the hint menu tree takes exactly this shape.  A very small game could dispense with the submenus and simply put all of the goals directly in the top hint menu.  A very large game with lots of goals could add more levels of sub-menus to make it easier to navigate the large number of topics.</p>

<p>The main work of building your hint system will be in defining your <a name="goal"></a><b>Goal</b> object. Each Goal typically represents a task that the player is currently trying to achieve. To avoid giving too much away prematurely you generally want to avoid displaying a Goal until the player knows s/he needs to achieve it, and to avoid cluttering your hints menu you generally want to stop offering hints for a Goal once it's been achieved. A Goal can thus be in one of three states: Undiscovered, Open and Closed. An Undiscovered Goal is one the player doesn't know about yet. An Open Goal is one the player should be currently working on. A Closed Goal is a task that no longer needs working on (either because it's been solved or because other circumstances have rendered it unnecessary). Goals generally start out Undiscovered and the library generally takes care of their state for you according to other properties you define (more on which immediately below), but if you want to provide the player with hints on something right from the start of the game (e.g. 'What am I mean to be doing?') you can define it as Open from the start by setting its goalState property to OpenGoal.</p>

<p>Otherwise, to make a Goal become open at the appropriate point of the game you can define one of the following properties to stipulate the conditions under which the Goal becomes open:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>openWhenSeen = <i>obj</i></b>: The Goal becomes open when the object defined on this property has been seen by the player character.</li>
<li><b>openWhenExamined = <i>obj</i></b>: The Goal becomes open when the object defined on this property has been examined by the player character.</li>
<li><b>openWhenMoved = <i>obj</i></b>: The Goal becomes open when the object defined on this property has been moved.</li>
<li><b>openWhenKnown = <i>obj</i></b>: The Goal becomes open when the player character knows about the object or topic defined on this property.</li>
<li><b>openWhenRevealed = <i>'key'</i></b>: The Goal becomes open when gRevealed('key') is true ('key' is an arbitrary string; you make it count as revealed by calling gRevealed('key')).</li>
<li><b>openWhenAchieved = <i>achievement</i></b>: The Goal becomes open when the achievement defined on this property has been achieved (as defined in the <a href="score">scoring</a> module).</li>
<li><b>openWhenTrue = <i>condition</i></b>: The Goal becomes open when the condition becomes true. This can be used to define any other condition not covered by those above.</li>
</ul>
 
<p>You close a Goal in exactly the same way, except that the properties for closing Goals are called closedWhenSeen, closeWhenExamined, closeWhenMoved, closeWhenKnown, closeWhenRevealed, closeWhenAchieved and closeWhenTrue.</p> 
 
<p>The other part of defining a Goal is defining the list of hints that lead towards its achievement. You define these on the menuContents property (the second item in a Goal template) as a list, normally of single-quoted strings, each one successively nudging the player towards the goal by giving just a bit more information or a slightler clearer clue (since they will be displayed one at a time); for example:</p>

<p><div class=code><pre>
+ Goal 'Where is the gold key?'
   [
      'What did the old man tell you?',
      'Specifically, about rhymes? ',
      'What rhymes with gold? ',
      'Have you seen anything cold round here? ',
      'What\'s the temperature like in the fountain? '
   ]
   
   openWhenSeen = goldDoor
   closeWhenSeen = goldKey
;

</pre></div>

<p>Occasionally, though, you may want to use a <a name="hint-idx">Hint</a> object instead of a single-quoted string in this list. This can be useful either when you want the same hint to appear in more than one list, or you want displaying the hint to open a fresh goal. For example, instead of the final item in the previous example we might have defined:</p>

<p><div class=code><pre>
fountainHint: Hint 'What\'s the temperature like in the fountain? ' [fountainGoal] ; 
</div>

<p>This would display the text "What\'s the temperature like in the fountain?" and at the same time open the fountainGoal Goal. (The properties of Hint used in this template are hintText, a single-quoted string, and referencedGoals, a list of Goal objects).</p>

<p>Occasionally we may want our hint menu to display some instructions that are always present, rather than transient hints. For this purpose we can use a <b>HintLongTopicItem</b>, which is the hint menu equivalent of a MenuLongTopicItem.</p>
<br>

<h2 id="extra">Extra Hints</h2>

<p>The hints described above are displayed when the player requests them. It may be, however, that if a player is getting stuck we want to offer him/her a few nudges even when they're not explicitly requested. This can either be because the player has asked for such nudges, or because some check in the game has determined that they may be needed. In adv3Lite such nudges are called ExtraHints. An ExtraHint is a little like a Hint, but instead of being displayed in response to a HINTS command, it is displayed when the game decides it should be.</p>

<p>To provide ExtraHints in your game, just define one or more objects of the ExtraHint class. These don't need to be located anywhere special; they'll automatically be associated with the extraHintManager object that controls them. The properties and methods of an ExtraHint that control when and what it displays are:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>hintDelay</strong>: the number of turns that must elapse after openWhen becomes true before this ExtraHint is displayed; the default is 0 but a higher number could be used to allow players to figure out a solution for themselves before being given a nudge.</li>
<li><strong>hintText</strong>: the text of the hint to display; this should be defined as a double-quoted string or as method that displays some text.</li>
<li><strong>priority</strong>: only one ExtraHint will be displayed on any one turn, so if more than one become available at the same time, the ExtraHint with the highest priority is the one that will be used. The default value of <span class="code">priority</span> is 100.</li>

</ul>

<p>In addition there are the properties that are used to decide when an ExtraHint become relevant and when it ceases to be relevant. The ExtraHint becomes applicable when its <strong>openWhen</strong> property becomes true, but game code would not normally use this property directly. Instead you should define one or more of <strong>openWhenSeen</strong>, <strong>openWhenExamined</strong>, <strong>openWhenMoved</strong>, <strong>openWhenKnown</strong>, <strong>openWhenAchieved</strong>, <strong>openWhenRevealed</strong> or <strong>openWhenTrue</strong>, which have the same meaning, and work the same way, as the same properties on <a href="#goal">Goal</a>. Similarly you can use one of more of <strong>closeWhenSeen</strong>, <strong>closeWhenExamined</strong>, <strong>closeWhenMoved</strong>, <strong>closeWhenKnown</strong>, <strong>closeWhenAchieved</strong>, <strong>closeWhenRevealed</strong> or <strong>closeWhenTrue</strong> to close off an ExtraHint that ceased to be relevant because the player has already done what it would prompt him or her to do. An ExtraHint is in any case closed off once it is fully displayed (more on which below), so the chief function of the closeWhenXXX properties is to prevent the display of unnecessary ExtraHints (bearing in mind not least that for ExtraHints there may be a delay between the openWhen condition becoming true and the display of the ExtraHint, as defined by the <span class="code">hintDelay</span> property).</p>


<p>The way you would use ExtraHints is to define a number of them at some convenient place in your code; they can probably all be defined as anonymous objects, for example:</p>

 <p><div class="code"><pre>
ExtraHint +7 "Try taking the document. "
    openWhenSeen = study
    closeWhenMoved = document    
;

ExtraHint +7 "Have you examined the desk yet?"
    openWhenSeen = study
    closeWhenExamined = desk
    
    priority = 110
;
</pre></div>

<p>Note how we can make use of the ExtraHint template to define the hintDelay and hintText properties of these ExtraHints. In this instance we're assuming that the game has a room called study in which, among other things, there are a desk and a document, and that once the player character has seen the study examining the desk and taking the document are two actions that should follow. Since these might well occur to the player in any case, we here allow a seven-turn delay before offering the hint. Since both hints might then want to be displayed on the same turn, we give the hint about examining the desk a higher priority so that it will take precedence. This is, to be sure, a somewhat artificial example, but it should serve to illustrate how ExtraHints might be used.</p>

<p>Although ExtraHints are displayed under circumstances determined by the game author, it's normally up to players to decide whether they want them at all, through issuing the commands EXTRA ON and EXTRA OFF. If you want your game to display extra hints even though the player hasn't asked for them, perhaps because your game has determined that the player is floundering (see the discussion of the <a href="newbie.htm#playerhelper">playerHelper</a> object for one way to determine that), you can call <span class="code">extraHintManager.activate()</span> to force the display of extra hints. If players don't like them, they can still banish them with an EXTRA OFF command, but this may be a tactic of last resort to use with a stubbornly struggling player who refused to ask for help!</p>

<p>Often, you'll only want to give the player a single nudge, and once the ExtraHint is displayed it will be closed off and not used again. But there may be some cases where you feel that a player may need more than one nudge, particularly if s/he fails to respond to the first. In such a case you can mix the ExtraHint in with an EventList class to provide a series of nudges, for example:</p>

 <p><div class="code"><pre>
ExtraHint, EventList +7 
    [
       'Try taking the document. ',
       'You really should take the document, you know. ',
       'To take the documemnt, use the command TAKE DOCUMENT. '
    ]
    openWhenSeen = study
    closeWhenMoved = document  
;
</pre></div>
<a name="setdelay"></a>
<p>In most cases you won't want these three hints to be displayed on successive terms, since you'd instead want to give players the opportunity to respond to the first nudge before giving them the second. In fact each of the hints in the list will be displayed <em>hintDelay</em> turns afer the last. But what happens if we want to vary the interval between hints? We can do this by means of the <strong>setDelay()</strong> method: calling <span class="code">setDelay(val)</span> will change the value of <span class="code">hintDelay</span> to <span class="code">val</span>, thereby reducing or increasing the number of turns that must elapse until the next hint in the series is displayed. But how and where can one call this method? Because single-quoted strings can contained embedded expressions, you might be tempted to make the following mistake: </p>

<p><div class="code"><pre>
ExtraHint, EventList +7 
    [
       'Try taking the document. &lt;&lt;setDelay(6)&gt;&gt;',  <b><FONT COLOR=RED>// DON'T DO THIS!</FONT></b>
       'You really should take the document, you know. &lt;&lt;setDelay(5)&gt;&gt;',
       'To take the documemnt, use the command TAKE DOCUMENT. '
    ]
    openWhenSeen = study
    closeWhenMoved = document  
;
</pre></div>

<p>The problem with code like this is that all the list elements are evaluated the first time the list is referenced, so that it will most likely result in the hintDelay being set to 5 all the way through. One way to avoid this is to embed the calls to setDelay in double-quoted strings inside anonymous functions, like this:</p>

<p><div class="code"><pre>
ExtraHint, EventList +7 
    [
       {: "Try taking the document. &lt;&lt;setDelay(6)&gt;&gt;" },  <b><FONT COLOR=GREEN>// DO THIS INSTEAD</FONT></b>
       {: "You really should take the document, you know. &lt;&lt;setDelay(5)&gt;&gt;"},
       'To take the documemnt, use the command TAKE DOCUMENT. '
    ]
    openWhenSeen = study
    closeWhenMoved = document  
;
</pre></div>

<p>If you use an EventList, as in the foregoing examples, then the ExtraHint will automatically close itself off after the last hint in the list has been displayed. If you want to keep repeating the final hint until the player acts on it you could use a StopEventList instead.</p>

<a name="ehstylytag"></a>
<p>By default extra hints are shown in italics. If you like you can change this by modifying the <strong>extraHintStyleTag</strong>. For example, to make the hints appear in bold blue, you'd define the following:</p>

 <p><div class="code"><pre>
modify extraHintStyleTag
    openText = '&lt;.p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color=blue&gt;'
    closeText = '&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;.p&gt;'
;
</pre></div>

<p>You need to be a bit careful about specifying particular colours like this, however; what may look good in your interpreter may not work at all well for your players if they've decided to set their interpreters to use a different set of colours, for example white text on a blue background! For that reason it may be safer to stick to using different styles (bold, italic, etc.) or prefix and suffix characters such a square brackets or asterisks, e.g.: </p>
 <p><div class="code"><pre>
modify extraHintStyleTag
    openText = '&lt;.p&gt;** '
    closeText = ' **&lt;.p&gt;'
;</pre></div>

<p>Of course, you can simply stick with the default italics here and not bother with modifying extraHintStyleTag at all.</p>

<p>Finally, the adv3Lite also implements a <a href='../techman/t3tips.htm'> Tips</a> system that is similar to Extra Hints but works a bit diffently and serves a slightly different purpose. Extra Hints are primarily intended for hints relevant to a specific game. Tips are designed to help new players with commands useful to IF in general, such as UNDO or OOPS, although they could also be used to give general advice about commands specific to your game (by informing players about the wording of the new command as opposed to a specific application under specific circumstances).</p>
