<h1>Conversation Nodes</h1>

<p>In a real conversation one party generally responds to what the other has just said. The particular response given is then only appropriate, and perhaps only meaningful, at that particular point in the conversation. For example, an NPC may have asked a question demanding an answer, perhaps yes or no. The replies YES and NO are then only meaningful in that particular context. Or at least, in the context of a different question they might have quite different meanings, and in general they might have no meaning at all. Or as another example, a remark by an NPC may make certain questions particularly appropriate. If an NPC announces that his best friend has just died, you might want to offer your condolences or ask how it happened. Again such responses are particularly relevant just at that particular point in the conversation, and might quickly become less relevant as the conversation moves on.</p>

<p>The adv3Lite library uses Conversation Nodes to model such moments in a conversation between the player character and another actor. In real-life conversation just about every moment in a conversation is a node in this sense, unless and until someone deliberately decides to change the subject. That is, in real-life conversation what has just been said generally places some constraints on what can reasonably be said next, even if we don't in fact choose what to say next from a finite set of choices set out in a mental menu. To model this thoroughly in IF conversation, i.e. to make every moment in the conversation a node, could quickly become extremely laborious, but the presence of some conversation nodes in a work of IF can lend some shape to the conversation, and certain situations (such as supplying the player character with appropriate Yes and No responses) would be quite impossible without them.</p>

<p>Thus far, we have used the term 'Conversation Node' to refer to the abstract concept, not to its implementation. The adv3 library used ConvNode objects to implement Conversation Nodes. You can also use ConvNode objects in adv3Lite (see <a href="#convnode">below</a>), but it is possible to set up Conversation Nodes without them, and we'll first explain how to do this before going on to explain the ConvNode class.</p>

<p>Conversation Nodes are implemented rather differently in adv3Lite from the way they work in adv3, once again making use of the convKeys property. In essence, using the tag <strong>&lt;.convnode key&gt;</strong> sets up a Conversation Node in which the TopicEntries whose convKeys match <em>key</em> are considered the most appropriate to use next. More specifically, &lt;.convnode key&gt; gives TopicEntries whose convKey matches <em>key</em> priority over all other TopicEntries in selecting the best match to the player's next conversational command. It follows that if there's a DefaultTopic with a convKeys property that matches <em>key</em>, then that DefaultTopic will mask other TopicEntries of the same kind for as long as the Conversation Node persists (by default, until the next conversational command has been executed). Defining a DefaultAnyTopic whose convKeys matches <em>key</em> is therefore a way of restricting the possible responses to those that match the conversation node key. If you want to list the conversational options open to the player on entering the Conversation Node place a &lt;.topics&gt; tag immediately after the &lt;.convnode&gt; tag (this isn't done by default since it may not always be appropriate; for example just after an NPC has asked what might be a purely rhetorical question) or use the &lt;.convnodet&gt; tag (which combines the effects of &lt;.convnode&gt; and &lt;.topics&gt;).</p>

<p>If multiple &lt;.convnode&gt; tags are output in succession, e.g. &lt;.convnode key1&gt;&lt;.convnode key1&gt;&lt;.convnode key3&gt;, the effect is to set up a Conversation Node that includes all the TopicEntries whose convKeys contain at least one of these keys (e.g. <em>key1</em> or <em>key2</em> or <em>key3</em>). This would be equivalent to:</p>
 <p><div class="code"><pre>
  someActor.addPendingKey('key1');
  someActor.addPendingKey('key2');
  someActor.addPendingKey('key3');
</pre></div>
<p>Or just:</p> 
 <p><div class="code"><pre>
  someActor.pendingKeys = ['key1', 'key2', 'key3'];
</pre></div>
<a name="nodeactive"></a>
<p>While this shows how to restrict or at least encourage the conversation to choose between a limited range of topics at a particular point (the Conversation Node), it does not show how we can make certain TopicEntries respond only at a given node (e.g., we may have several YesTopics and NoTopics, and we want each one only to respond just after the relevant question has been asked). We can restrict an ActorTopicEntry's applicability to a specific node by setting its isActive property to <strong>nodeActive()</strong>. An ActorTopicEntry's nodeActive() method evaluates to true only if its convKeys overlaps with the actor's current activeKeys (i.e. with the pendingKeys that were set up on the previous turn).</p>

<p>Finally, to stay at the same Conversation Node for more than one conversational turn we can use the <strong>&lt;.convstay&gt;</strong> tag (or set the actors's keepPendingKeys property to true). Note that we'd have to do this on each additional turn we wanted to stay in the same Conversation Node. If the conversation does stay at the same node, you  may want the NPC to be able to prompt the player character for a response if the player does not issue a conversational command on any turn. For this purpose you can define a <strong>NodeContinuationTopic</strong>, and set its convKeys property to the current node (or to a list of all the nodes in which you want it to be active.</p>

<p>Just to emphasize the point about the &lt;.convstay&gt; tag. If you want to give the player more than one chance to choose one of the specific options offered at a Conversation Node, then you <em>must</em> include a DefaultTopic with a &lt;.convstay&gt; tag in that Node, otherwise any conversational response that doesn't match one of your specific options will move the conversation on beyond the Node and the player will forever have lost the chance to pick one of your special responses.</p>

<p>This should all become clearer with the aid of a few examples.</p>
<br>

<a name="examples"></a><h2>Examples</h2>

<p>You may recall in the previous section we gave an example of a QueryTopic that included a question at the end of the NPC's response:</p>

<p><div class="code"><pre>
+ QueryTopic 'how' 'old he is; are you'
    &quot;&lt;q&gt;How old are you?&lt;/q&gt; you ask.\b
    &lt;q&gt;None of your damned business,&lt;/q&gt; he replies. &lt;q&gt;Would you like someone
    asking you about your age?&lt;/q&gt; &quot;
      
    askMatchObj = tAge    
;
</pre></div>

<p>Perhaps the question "Would you like someone asking you about your age?" is a purely rhetorical one, but it at least invites the player to respond YES or NO; but clearly any YES or NO responses given would be particular to this precise point in the conversation: they wouldn't be relevant any sooner or any later. In other words, with this question the conversation has arrived at a Conversation Node.</p>

<p>To implement the node we could simply add a &lt;.convnode&gt; tag to the end of Bob's response, and then a YesTopic and a NoTopic keyed to the same node:</p>

<p><div class="code"><pre>
+ QueryTopic 'how' 'old he is; are you'
    &quot;&lt;q&gt;How old are you?&lt;/q&gt; you ask.\b
    &lt;q&gt;None of your damned business,&lt;/q&gt; he replies. &lt;q&gt;Would you like someone
    asking you about your age?&lt;/q&gt; &lt;.convnode age-node&gt;&quot;
      
    askMatchObj = tAge    
;


+ YesTopic
    &quot;&lt;q&gt;Yes, sure, I wouldn't mind,&lt;/q&gt; you reply.\b
    &lt;q&gt;Well, I do,&lt;/q&gt; he grunts. &quot;
    convKeys = ['age-node']     
;

+ NoTopic
    &quot;&lt;q&gt;No, I suppose not,&lt;/q&gt; you concede.\b
    &lt;q&gt;Well, there you are then!&lt;/q&gt; he declares triumphantly. &quot;
    convKeys = ['age-node']    
;

</pre></div>

<p>There's nothing magic about the name 'age-node' by the way. We don't have to include 'node' in the name just because we're setting up a Conversation Node; doing so just makes the purpose of the convKey a bit clearer.</p>

<p>The above implementation will work after a fashion, in that if the player types YES or NO immediately after the NPC asks "Would you like someone asking you about your age?" s/he'll get the expected response. The trouble is, there's nothing that <em>restricts</em> these yes and no responses to this particular Conversation Node. As we've defined them, they could be triggered by the player typing YES or NO at any point. To restrict them to this particular Conversation Node we need to set their isActive property to nodeActive:</p>

 <p><div class="code"><pre>
+ YesTopic
    "&lt;q&gt;Yes, sure, I wouldn't mind,&lt;/q&gt; you reply.\b
    &lt;q&gt;Well, I do,&lt;/q&gt; he grunts. "
    convKeys = ['age-node']
    isActive = nodeActive    
;

+ NoTopic
    "&lt;q&gt;No, I suppose not,&lt;/q&gt; you concede.\b
    &lt;q&gt;Well, there you are then!&lt;/q&gt; he declares triumphantly. "
    convKeys = ['age-node']
    isActive = nodeActive    
;
</pre></div>

<p>Note that if we had listed several keys in the convKeys property of these TopicEntries, they would have been available in those other Conversation Nodes as well; this makes such TopicEntries potentially reusable. Note also that we could also include a response here that's also available outside the ConversationNode. For example, suppose we also wanted the player character to be able to respond at this point by telling the NPC his age, but we wanted him to be able to do so elsewhere as well. We could achieve that by defining a TellTopic that had 'age-node' in its convKeys property but didn't set its isActive property to nodeActive:</p>

 <p><div class="code"><pre>
+ TellTopic @tYourAge
    "<q>I'm forty-three,</q> you tell him.\b
    <q>Well bully for you!</q> he declares. "
    convKeys = ['age-node']
    autoName = true
;
</pre></div>

<p>Note also that if you do set isActive to nodeActive, there is nothing to stop you adding further conditions to the isActive property (<span class="code">isActive = nodeActive &amp;&amp; whatever</span>) if you need them.</p>

<p>So far we have supposed that Bob intended his question rhetorically. But if he actually expects an answser to "Would you like someone asking you about your age?" we could make him prompt the player for one until he receives it. For this purpose we can define a <strong>NodeContinuationTopic</strong> and set its convKeys property to the appropriate node:</p>

 <p><div class="code"><pre>
+ NodeContinuationTopic
    "&lt;q&gt;I thought I asked you a question,&lt;/q&gt; Bob reminds you. "
    convKeys = ['age-node']
;
</pre></div>

<p>There's no need to define the isActive property here, since NodeContinuationTopic defines is as nodeActive by default. Note, however, that we could have mixed NodeContinuationTopic in with an EventList class and provided a list of different nudges for Bob to say. Either way the NodeContinuationTopic will run on each turn that the player does not enter a conversational command.</p>

<p>As things stand, the player still does not need to reply with one of the topics belonging to the Conversation Node (even though these will be the only ones listed in response to a TOPICS command or a &lt;.topics&gt; tag). Any conversational command entered by the player will serve to move the conversation on. But if Bob is really insistent on an answer to his question, you may want to so arrange things that the conversation cannot move on until the player has provided a satisfactory reply (i.e. one matching a topic specifically belonging to the Conversation Node). The way to do this is to define a DefaultTopic that's only active in the node in question, but which blocks attempts to leave the node until a satisfactory reply is given. For example:</p>

 <p><div class="code"><pre>    
+ DefaultAnyTopic
    &quot;&lt;q&gt;Don't try to change the subject; I want to know whether you'd like
    someone asking about your age,&lt;/q&gt; he insists. &lt;q&gt;Well, would you?&lt;/q&gt;
    &lt;.convstay&gt; &lt;.topics&gt; &quot;
    convKeys = ['age-node']
    isActive = nodeActive
;
</pre></div>
<a name="convstay"></a>
<p>It's very important that we remember to define <span class="code">isActive = nodeActive</span> here, otherwise this DefaultAnyTopic might be fired at any time. Note the use of the &lt;.convstay&gt; tag to keep the Conversation at the current node. The use of the &lt;.topics&gt; tag to remind the player of what topics are available within the node is optional here, but might serve as a useful reminder, as well as a nudge to pick one of them. You can also combine the function of both tags at once with a <strong>&lt;.constayt&gt;</strong> tag. Similarly, you can combine the effects of a &lt;.convode node&gt; and a &lt;.topics&gt; tag with a single <strong>&lt;.convodet node&gt;</strong> tag. As we'll see below, it may often be preferable to use a <a href='#defcontop'>DefaultConvstayTopic</a> in place of a <span class='code'>DefaultAnyTopic</span> here.</p>

<p><a name="nodecheck"></a>There's one further refinement we can add, if we want to, and that's to prevent the conversation being terminated while it's at this node. To do this we need to define a <strong>NodeEndCheck</strong> object (in fact a special kind of InitiateTopic) with the appropriate convKeys and then define its <strong>canEndConversation(reason)</strong> method to return nil, or blockEndConv, if we want to disallow ending the conversation. For example, to prevent the player character from saying goodbye while we're at this node we could define:</p>

 <p><div class="code"><pre>
+ NodeEndCheck
    canEndConversation(reason)
    {
        if(reason == endConvBye)
        {
            &quot;&lt;q&gt;&lt;q&gt;Goodbye,&lt;/q&gt; isn't an answer,&lt;/q&gt; Bob complains. &lt;q&gt;Would
            you like someone to ask you about your age or wouldn't you?&lt;/q&gt; &quot;;
                              
            return blockEndConv;
        }
        
        return true;
    }
    
    convKeys = ['age-node']
;
</pre></div>

<p>Once again we don't need to explicitly define the isActive property of the NodeEndCheck object since the NodeEndCheck class already defines it to be nodeActive. We have the canEndConversation() method return <strong>blockEndConv</strong> rather than just nil here to suppress any output our NodeContinuationTopic might otherwise produce on the same turn, which we may not want if Bob has already just spoken (in adv3Lite blockEndConv() is in fact a method of NodeContinuationTopic that calls noteConversed() on the Actor and then returns nil; it's called blockEndConv for consistency with adv3 although the implementation is quite different). An alternative method would have been to have canEndConversation display a much more generic refusal to accept a goodbye and then return nil, leaving the NodeContinuationTopic to prompt the player with Bob's specific question. That way we could list several conversation nodes in the NodeEndCheck's convKeys property and have the one NodeEndCheck object block saying goodbye in them all.</p>

<a name='sayblock'></a>
<p>For a fuller explanation of the <em>reason</em> parameter, of saying goodbye, and of checking whether conversations are allowed to end, see the section on <a href="hello.htm">Hello and Goodbye</a> below.</p>
<p>As an alternative to defining the canEndConversation(reason) method on a NodeEndCheck object it may often be convenient to define or more of the following properties on it:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>sayBlockTravel</b>: the response to an attempt to end a conversation during this ConvNode by moving to another location.</li>
<li><b>sayBlockBye</b>: the response to an attempt to end a conversation during this ConvNode by saying BYE.</li>
<li><b>sayBlockBoredrom</b>: the response to an attempt to end a converstion during this ConvNode by exhausting the NPC's patience through carrying out a number of non-conversational actions.</li>
<li><b>defaultVal</b>: this is the return value (usually true or nil) we want canEndConversation() to return if none of our sayBlockXXX properties intervenes. This defaults to treu to allow the conversation to be ended, but we could override this to nil on NodeEndChecks that we want to default to blocking ending the conversation.</li>
</ul>
<p>By this means, the <span class='code'>NodeEndCheck</span> object in our previous example could be defined rather more concisely as:</p>
 <p><div class="code"><pre>
+ NodeEndCheck
    sayblockBye = &quot;&lt;q&gt;&lt;q&gt;Goodbye,&lt;/q&gt; isn't an answer,&lt;/q&gt; Bob complains. &lt;q&gt;Would
            you like someone to ask you about your age or wouldn't you?&lt;/q&gt; &quot;  
    
    convKeys = ['age-node']
;
</pre></div>

<p>The various sayBlockXXX properties can be defined as one of:</p>

<ul>
<li>A single-quoted string, in which case the string is displayed and we return nil to block ending the conversation without treating what has just been displayed as a conversational response.</li>
<li>A double-quoted string, in which case the string is displayed and we return <span class='code'>blockEndConv</span> so that the response is treated as conversational (to prevent any NodeContinuationTopic being triggered on the same turn).</li>
<li>A method, in which case the method is executed and we return its return value (which should be one of nil, true, or blockEndConv).</li>
<li>An EventList, in which case its doScript() method is called and we return <span class='code'>blockEndConv</span> to treat it as as conversational response.</li>
<li>Any other kind of object that defines a <b>block()</b> method (with no arguments), in which case that object's block method will be called and its return value (true, nil, or blockEndConv) used to determine whether or not the conversation can end.</li>
<li>A property pointer, in which case the method it points to on the NodeEndCheck will be executed and its return value used to determine whether or not the conversation can end.</li>
<li>The value <b>true</b> in which case the conversation will be allowed to end without further ado.</li>
<li>An enum (<b>null</b> would be a convenient one to use) in which case ending the conversation will be ruled out (with no explanation).</li>
</ul>




<h2><a name="convnode">Using the ConvNode Class</a></h2>

<p>As we have just seen, it is perfectly possible to set up a Conversation Node in adv3Lite without the use of a special ConvNode object. In some cases, however, using a ConvNode object can save a bit of repetitive typing and help to make the structure of the code clearer.</p>

<p>An adv3Lite ConvNode is a specialization of an adv3Lite TopicGroup. This means that any TopicEntries located within a ConvNode have the ConvNode's convKeys added to any they may define individually, and that for them to be active both their own and the ConvNode's isActive properties must be true. A ConvNode defines <span class="code">isActive = nodeActive</span>, which means that the ConvNode becomes active when its convKeys are those of an active node.</p>

<p>This may all sound a bit complicated, but the practical upshot is that to define a Conversation Node we can simply define its convKeys property to be that corresponding to the node we want, and then locate the associated TopicEntries within it. The TopicGroup template, which ConvNode inherits, makes this even easier, since we can just put the relevant convKey name in single quotes after <span class="code">ConvNode</span>. ConvNode objects themselves should be located directly in the Actors with which they are meant to be associated.</p>

<p>Using a ConvNode object, the Conversation Node illustrated above could be defined like this:</p>

<p><div class="code"><pre>
+ QueryTopic 'how' 'old he is; are you'
    &quot;&lt;q&gt;How old are you?&lt;/q&gt; you ask.\b
    &lt;q&gt;None of your damned business,&lt;/q&gt; he replies. &lt;q&gt;Would you like someone
    asking you about your age?&lt;/q&gt; &lt;.convnode age-node&gt;&quot;
      
    askMatchObj = tAge    
;

+ ConvNode 'age-node';

++ YesTopic
    &quot;&lt;q&gt;Yes, sure, I wouldn't mind,&lt;/q&gt; you reply.\b
    &lt;q&gt;Well, I do,&lt;/q&gt; he grunts. &quot;         
;

++ NoTopic
    &quot;&lt;q&gt;No, I suppose not,&lt;/q&gt; you concede.\b
    &lt;q&gt;Well, there you are then!&lt;/q&gt; he declares triumphantly. &quot;        
;

++ DefaultConvstayTopic
    &quot;&lt;q&gt;Don't try to change the subject; I want to know whether you'd like
    someone asking about your age,&lt;/q&gt; he insists. &lt;q&gt;Well, would you?&lt;/q&gt;
    &lt;.topics&gt; &quot;  
;

++ NodeContinuationTopic
    "&lt;q&gt;I thought I asked you a question,&lt;/q&gt; Bob reminds you. "   
;

++ NodeEndCheck
    sayblockBye = &quot;&lt;q&gt;&lt;q&gt;Goodbye,&lt;/q&gt; isn't an answer,&lt;/q&gt; Bob complains. &lt;q&gt;Would
            you like someone to ask you about your age or wouldn't you?&lt;/q&gt; &quot;    
;
</pre></div>
<a name='defcontop'></a>
<p>Note that we have replaced our previous DefaultAnyTopic with a <b>DefaultConvstayTopic</b>. A DefaultConvstayTopic automatically adds a &lt;.convstay&gt; tag to what it outputs, which removes the need to type it for ourselves (which could become quite a significant saving if we have a lot of DefaultTopics in ConvNodes in our game, or if our DefaultConvstayTopic is mixed in with an EventList). In this example we've also defined &lt;.topics&gt; tag to force a list of suggested topics. If we wanted all our DefaultConvstayTopics to do this, we could override the <b>convstayTag</b> property on the DefaultConvstayTopic to '&lt;.convstayt&gt;'. We could also do this on individual DefaultConvstayTopics, but that wouldn't save much typing unless the DefaultConvstayTopic was mixed in with an EventList. In any case, overriding on the class will provide greater consistency in your game.</p>

<p>Using DefaultConvstayTopic instead of DefaultAnyTopic in a ConvNode brings an additional benefit: it prevents KISS, TOUCH/FEEL and ATTACK/HIT commands from accidentally breaking out of a conversation node you want the player to stay in (since DefaultAnyTopics don't match these commands). Instead a DefaultConvstayTopic will respond to these commands with its <b>nonConvResponse</b>. The library defines this as "Best keep your mind on the conversation", but you can override this to anything you like, either as a double-quoted string or a method to display text. Such a method could check the value of topicMatched to see whether it's kissTopicObj, hitTopicObj,or touchTopicObj and vary the response accordingly. If, however, you want to use a DefaultConstayTopic to add &lt;.convstay&gt; tags without also matching KISS, HIT and FEEL, you can override its <b>matchNonConv</b> property to nil (though this may not be a good idea, for the reasons just explained).</p>

<p>Since <span class='code'>DefaultConvstayTopic</span> is quite a lot to type you can abbreviate it to <b>DCT</b> (a macro). You can similarly abbreviate NodeContinuationTopic to <b>NCT</b> and NodeEndCheck to <b>NEC</b>.


<a name="curnode"></a>
<p>If you use the ConvNode class to set up your Conversation Nodes, you can use various methods on the Actor object to test whether a ConvNode is currently active for that actor and if so which one it is. If you simply want to test whether there is an active ConvNode, test whether <strong>curNodeIdx()</strong> returns a number (meaning there is one) or nil (meaning there isn't). The <strong>curNodeKey()</strong> method returns the convKeys value associated with the current ConvNode (if there is one) or nil otherwise, while the <strong>curNodeObj()</strong> method returns the current ConvNode object, if there is one.</p>
