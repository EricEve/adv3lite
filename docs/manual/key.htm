<h1>Keys</h1>
<p>As we have seen, we can define the lockability property of a Thing (typically a Door or an openable container) to be lockableWithKey, which means that the player character needs a key to lock and unlock it. The other part of setting up something to be locked and unlocked with a key is defining the appropriate Key object (or objects, since any number of keys can be defined to work on one lock if we so wish). For this purpose the core library defines the Key class.</p>

<p>The one property we have to define on a Key is the list of things it locks and unlocks (since a Key may be defined to work on any number of objects, if we so wish). We do this simply by listing the objects the Key works on in its <b>actualLockList</b> property.</p>

<p>A Key also maintains a <b>knownLockList</b> property, which is a list of objects the player character knows that this key locks and unlocks (this helps the parser to select the right key in cases of ambiguity, or when the player issues a LOCK or UNLOCK command without specifying which key to use). By default the library since adds objects to this list once the key has been successfully used to lock or unlock them, but you can if you wish define objects on this list if the player character starts out knowing what the key is for (e.g., the player character would presumably recognize her own front door key).</p>

<p>A third property you can optionally define is the <b>plausibleLockList</b>. This is a list of the objects the key looks like it might plausibly lock and unlock (typically because it's roughly the right size and shape). It's obvious, for example, that a large iron key designed to open the main door of an old church isn't going to unlock a tiny jewelry box, and equally obvious that a yale key isn't going to fit a cardkey lock. Defining this property can thus help the parser to make better decisions about which key a player most likely intends to use. Defining this property is a bit of extra work, and it isn't essential, but it will provide the player with a better playing experience if you take the trouble to do it.</p>

<p>Thus, for example, we might define a front door key as follows:</p>

<p><div class=code><pre>
 brassKey: Key 'brass key; medium sized'    
    "It's just a medium sized brass key, typical of the sort used to lock and
    unlock doors. "
    plausibleLockList = [frontDoor, frontDoorOutside, backDoor, backDoorOutside]
    actualLockList = [frontDoor, frontDoorOutside]
;
</pre></div>

<p>Note that we have to specify both sides of the frontDoor in the actualLockList property if we want the key to work on both sides. Otherwise we define a Key in just the same way as we would any other Thing, except that there are two further properties of possible interest:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>notAPlausibleKeyMsg</b> (single-quoted string) The message to display if the player tries to use this key to lock or unlock an object that's neither in this Key's actualLockList or its plausibleLockList.</li>
<li><b>keyDoesntFitMsg</b> (single-quoted string) The message to display if the player tries to use this key on a lock it doesn't fit.</p>
</ul>
