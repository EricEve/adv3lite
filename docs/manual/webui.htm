<h1>The Web UI</h1>

<p>As in adv3, so in adv3Lite, you can choose between the traditional TADS
user interface or the new Web UI. The method for configuring this is almost identical
to that used for the standard adv3 library, apart from one or two file-names. For the full 
details, see the section on "Playing on the Web" in the <em>TADS 3 System Manual</em>. In 
the present section we reproduce part of that material, duly adapted for use with adv3Lite.</p>


<p>In the traditional UI, the user
installs a TADS interpreter on his or her machine, and the interpreter
displays the user interface using the native features of the operating
system &mdash; opening a window on the Mac, for example, or writing to the
terminal window on Unix.  With the Web UI, the user interface isn't
part of the TADS interpreter at all, but instead runs in a standard
Web browser.  The game still runs in the TADS interpreter, but the
interpreter doesn't show any UI windows; instead, the game sends
everything to the Web browser for display, via a network connection.

<p>The Web UI configuration offers several big new capabilities beyond
what's possible with the traditional TADS user interface:

<ul class=doublespace>

   <li><b>Web-based play.</b>  You can set things up so that users can play
   your game directly in a browser, without installing your game or
   any TADS software on their machines.  Users simply point their
   browser to a URL, and the game runs in the browser window.  There's
   nothing for players to download or install &mdash; not even a plug-in, since
   the UI is built entirely on standard Web technologies that are native
   to all modern browsers (HTML, CSS, Javascript, and AJAX).  Your game
   and the TADS interpreter run on a separate Web server machine;
   the user only needs to know the URL to the server, which you can
   easily supply via a hyperlink on your own Web page.

   <li><b>Full support for Javascript, CSS, and HTML DOM.</b>  The
   traditional HTML TADS user interface uses an "extended subset"
   of the older HTML 3.2 standard, and has no support for
   CSS, Javascript, or HTML DOM access.  With the Web UI, you have
   access to all of those technologies, plus full standard HTML,
   because the UI runs in an actual browser.  HTML TADS is certainly
   more optimized for the traditional text game UI than a browser is,
   but the trade-off is that it's narrowly focused on that one type of
   UI.  Web browsers are much more flexible and powerful as UI platforms.

   <li><b>Multiuser gaming.</b>  A key TADS feature that makes the Web UI
   possible is a network server capability.  The network capability goes
   beyond just talking to the browser, though: it's really a full-featured
   networking layer that lets a game communicate with multiple clients,
   opening up numerous possibilities for collaborative and multi-user
   games.  Although the Adv3Lite library is only designed for a single player
   character, its new Web UI support does allow multiple people to
   connect to the same session and play the game collaboratively.

</ul>


<a name="choosing"></a><h2>Choosing between the regular UI and the Web UI</h2>

<p>The Web UI is a whole separate output layer from the traditional
user interface, with its own set of functions.  This is good news and
bad news.

<p>The good news is that the Web UI gives you vastly more control and
power than the traditional console UI offers.  For one thing, all of
the networking features are directly available - they're not hidden
inside the interpreter, but are readily accessible and controllable
from your program.  For another, you have direct access to all of the
browser-side coding: you can write your own HTML, CSS, Javascript, and
AJAX code to run in the browser, so you can customize virtually every
aspect of the user interface.  There's absolutely nothing about the
Web UI that's built into the interpreter; everything that's predefined
is simply part of the library, so it's readily accessible and
customizable.  Your game's UI can do anything that a Web site can do -
drag-and-drop, animation, dynamic pop-up lists, layered objects,
menus, and on and on.

<p>The bad news is that <b>you must choose in advance</b> whether your
game will use the Web UI or the traditional UI.  If you stick to the
basic command-line user interface, the only difference is in compiler
options, so you can actually compile the same game both ways &mdash; so
you'd have a single set of source files, but you'd compile it twice,
once into a .t3 file for conventional play, and again into a separate
.t3 for Web play.  On the other hand, if you decide to take advantage
of the more advanced features of the conventional UI (such as sound
playback or the Banner API), or if you want to customize the
Javascript front end of the Web UI, your game will be tied to the UI
that you choose.

<p>If you have an existing game that you created with a previous TADS
3 version, you can port it to the Web UI.  If you were careful to use
only Adv3Lite functions for input and output, rather than calling built-in
interpreter functions directly, porting your game to the Web UI should
be a simple matter of recompiling with the Web UI compiler settings.
If you made use of more advanced UI features, though, porting requires
somewhat more work:

<ul>
   <li>the banner API
   <li>sound playback
   <li>non-standard TADS HTML tags
</ul>


<a name="creating"></a><h3>Creating a new Web UI game from scratch</h3>

<p>The first step in creating a Web UI game is to set up your build
instructions (your project's .t3m file) to include the networking
functions and the Web UI version of the Adv3Lite library.

<p><i>If you're using Workbench on Windows:</i> Select the Create New
Project command.  The "wizard" dialog will ask you which type of user
interface to use; select the "Adv3Lite - Web UI" option from the list
of project types.

<p><i>If you're creating your project file manually:</i> Follow the
standard procedure for creating a .t3m file for a regular Adv3Lite game.
Once you've set up the basic .t3m file, follow the instructions
<a href="#manual_port">below</a> for changing a .t3m file from a
conventional game to the Web UI.


<a name="porting"></a><h3>Porting an existing game</h3>

<p>To port an existing game based on the traditional console user
interface (including HTML TADS games), the first step is to switch to
the Web UI libraries.  This requires a few changes to your project's
.t3m file.

<p><font color=red>Attention Workbench users on Windows:</font> It's possible to make
the necessary changes using Workbench, but the procedure is actually a
bit easier if you edit the .t3m file manually, so the explanation
below assumes you're going that route.  <i>Close Workbench</i> before
proceeding, and use a different editor, such as Notepad.  <i>Don't</i>
attempt to edit the .t3m file using Workbench or while it's open in
Workbench, since Workbench will overwrite any changes you make as long
as Workbench has it open.

<p><a name="manual_port">Here's the procedure to update your .t3m file
   to use the Web UI:

<ul class=doublespace>
      
   <li>Open your project's .t3m file in a <b>non-Workbench</b> editor
   (e.g., Notepad on Windows)

   <li>At the start of the file (after any comments, but before the first
   source file is listed), add <b>-D TADS_INCLUDE_NET</b>
   
   <li>Change the line <b>-lib adv3Lite</b> to
   <b>-lib adv3LiteWeb</b>
   
   <li>Add the following lines immediately after the 
   <b>-lib adv3LiteWeb</b> line we just updated (but after any
   <b>-x</b> lines that happen to follow it):
   
   <ul>
      <li><b>-lib webui</b>
      <li><b>-source tadsnet</b>
   </ul>
   
</ul>

<p>The first item, <b>-D TADS_INCLUDE_NET</b>, tells the compiler to
include the network-related built-in functions.  These interfaces
aren't included by default because they're not universally supported
on all interpreters, and a game that includes them won't run on an
interpreter that doesn't support them.  This makes it better to omit
them unless you actually make use of them, which of course you must
for a Web UI game.

<p>The second item, <b>-lib adv3LiteWeb</b>, selects the Web version
of the Adv3Lite library.  Adv3LiteWeb emulates all of the programming
interfaces from Adv3Lite related to basic command-line interactions, such
as displaying text or HTML output, reading command lines, reading
keystrokes, and so on.  This lets you write a Web UI game as though it
were a standard console-based game.

<p>The third item, <b>-lib webui -source tadsnet</b>, adds the TADS
Web UI library to the build, along with some helper classes for the
networking interfaces.  The Web UI library is a separate component
from Adv3LiteWeb.  Adv3LiteWeb doesn't actually implement the Web interface,
but rather implements an emulation of the traditional Adv3Lite input and
output functions on top of the Web UI library.  The Web UI library is
a whole separate subsystem that consists of a Javascript library that
runs in the user's Web browser, and a TADS library that runs on the
server machine hosting the game.  The TADS and Javascript portions
communicate with each other using the TADS networking system.

<p>The Web UI library is analogous to the traditional input/output
functions built into the interpreter.  With traditional console-based
games, you always had the option to bypass the Adv3Lite library and work
directly with the interpreter built-ins.  For Web-based games, you
similarly have the option to bypass the Adv3LiteWeb library and work
directly with the Web UI library.  If you do so, of course, your game
will be inextricably tied to the Web UI - you won't be able to easily
port it back to the console UI later.  But the trade-off is that you
can exploit the full power of Javascript in the browser.


<p>Depending on how much custom UI work you use in your existing game,
the library additions above might be all you have to do.  The Adv3LiteWeb
library emulates the input and output functions in Adv3Lite, so you won't
have to change anything related to displaying text or reading input as
long as you used Adv3Lite functions for I/O rather than calling the
interpreter built-ins directly.

<p>If you use any HTML image or audio files, such as JPEG images,
there's an extra step.  See <a href="#resfiles">resource files</a>
below.

<p>To test your game in Web UI mode, recompile with the .t3m changes
above.  If it compiles successfully, try running it.  If you're using
Windows, HTML TADS will run a Web UI game locally as though it were a
standard game - so you don't have to set up a Web server to test Web
UI mode.

<p>If you encounter any compiler errors building your game after
making the .t3m changes, you must have used a part of Adv3Lite that isn't
supported in the Web version.  The most likely missing piece is the
banner API - Adv3LiteWeb doesn't support it.  The Javascript front end has
analogous capabilities, but the specifics are different enough that
there's no Adv3LiteWeb emulation for the console-mode banners.

<p>If the game compiles successfully, but doesn't work correctly when
you run it, your game probably calls built-in functions in the
interpreter rather than using the Adv3Lite equivalents.  You'll have to
examine your code and eliminate calls to built-ins.


<a name="buildingboth"></a><h3>Building the same game both ways</h3>

<p>If you stick to the basic command-line user interface, and you're
careful to use Adv3Lite library methods for all of your input/output
operations, porting from the console UI to the Web UI is usually just
a matter of changing your .t3m file as described above.

<p>An interesting implication is that you can easily create both UI
versions of your game from the same set of source files.  If you
create two copies of your .t3m file - one for the console UI, and
another for the Web UI - creating the two versions is just a matter of
compiling the game with each .t3m file.

<p>Why would you want to do this?  The main reason is to accommodate
different users' preferences.  Playing on the Web has a number of
advantages (greater portability, no need to install anything, the
ability to resume a saved game on different machines, multi-user
collaboration), but the traditional console UI has some advantages of
its own (faster response time, no need to be connected to the Internet
while playing).  Offering both versions of your game lets users pick
the mode that works better for them.

<p>Here are some tips for creating a dual-mode game:

<ul class=doublespace>

   <li>When you create your two .t3m files, give the final
   .t3 file (specified with the "-o" option) a different name
   for each version.  For example, use "-o mygame.t3" for the console
   version, and "-o mygameWeb.t3" for the Web UI version.
   
   <li>When you're ready to build the two versions, be sure to
   do a <i>full</i> build of each version, so that all of the
   intermediate files are rebuilt from scratch.  If you're compiling
   from the command line, use the -a option (<span class="code">t3make -a -f mygame</span>).
   If you're compiling with Workbench on Windows, use the "Full Recompile
   for Debugging" command (note that "Compile for Release" always
   does a full build, so you can use that command as well).

   <li>If you follow the <a href="#Adv3WebUsageTips">Adv3LiteWeb usage tips</a>
   we'll see later in this chapter, all of your source
   code should work equally well in both modes.  However, you might
   decide that you want to create some special effects that require
   calling the built-in I/O functions and/or the Javascript UI
   directly.  If you do, you'll have to write a different version of
   that special code for each UI mode.  There are two ways to isolate
   code that works only in one or the other UI mode:

   <ul class=doublespace>

      <li>You can use <span class="code">#ifdef TADS_INCLUDE_NET</span> to mark off sections
      that apply only to one or the other mode.  Recall that we added
      this symbol to the .t3m file for the Web UI only, so if this symbol
      is defined, you know you're compiling the Web UI version.

<p><div class="code"><pre>
#ifdef TADS_INCLUDE_NET
   special code for the Web UI goes here
#else
   special code for the console UI goes here
#endif
</pre></div>

      <li>Alternatively, if you have extensive code for the two modes,
      it can be cleaner to separate the variant code into two separate
      source files.  Create one file that's exclusively for the Web
      UI, and another that's exclusively for the console UI.  In your
      .t3m files, include a <span class="code">-source</span> line for the appropriate
      source file for each build.  This ensures that the Web UI
      source file is only included in the Web UI build, and the console
      source file is only in the console build.  Adv3Lite itself uses this
      approach - it has a file called console.t that's only included
      in the traditional Adv3Lite library source list, and another called
      browser.t that's only included in the Adv3LiteWeb source list.

   </ul>


</ul>


<h2><a name="resfiles">Resource files</a></h2>

<p>If you use HTML resources such as images or audio files (JPEGs,
PNGs, MP3s, etc), there's an extra detail to tend to: you have to tell
the library that it's okay for client browsers to download those
files.  The library is cautious about network security, so by default
it doesn't let clients download anything without your say-so.

<p>It's fairly easy to specify resource download permissions.  First,
you should group your resources into one or more folders - that is,
subdirectories of your main project folder for the game.  Second,
for each folder, add an object definition like this to your game:

<p><div class="code"><pre>
WebResourceResFile
   vpath = static new RexPattern('/foldername/')
;
</pre></div>

<p>That tells the library to treat anything in the "foldername"
subdirectory of the game folder as an HTML resource, allowing the
client browser to download those files.  It's just an ordinary object
definition, so you can put it anywhere in your source code that object
definitions are allowed.  If you divide your resources into multiple
folders, just add a definition like the one above for each folder.
(You don't have to do this for subfolders, though - the '/foldername/'
definition will allow files in subfolders of 'foldername'.)


<h2><a name="shutdown">QUIT, disconnect, and program termination</a></h2>

<p>In the traditional console UI, the way the game program terminates
is fairly straightforward.  When the player types QUIT, the Adv3Lite
command loop exits, which unwinds the call stack until the <span class="code">main()</span>
function returns.  This terminates the game program, at which point
the interpreter program exits to the operating system.  Alternatively,
on GUI versions (such as QTads or HTML TADS), the player can end the
program by closing the main window.  This is processed in much the
same way as QUIT internally: the interpreter sends an "end of file"
indication to the command loop, to let it know that no more input is
forthcoming (as there's no way for the player to enter more input
without the main window), causing the command loop to exit.

<p>With the Web UI, things aren't quite as simple.  The complication
is that the player and the game are on separate computers.  At first
glance, it might seem as though we could take the same approach: if
the player types QUIT or closes their browser, we should simply let
the TADS program terminate as usual.  But what happens if the player's
network connection momentarily lapses?  We obviously don't want to
treat that the same way as an intentional disconnection, but it's not
always possible to tell the difference with the network protocols
involved.  And what happens if the player presses the Refresh button
in their browser?  It turns out that "Refresh" and "Close Page" are
essentially indistinguishable from the perspective of a Web page.
Further, what happens if the player types QUIT, but still wants to see
what's on the page for a while after?  If they try to refresh the page
after typing QUIT, the server - the game program - still has to be
running to service the request.

<p>To handle these various situations, the Web UI has to use a
different approach to managing its session lifetime.  For the Web UI,
the program's job is larger than merely running the game; it's also
acting as a Web server.  The Web server's lifetime isn't defined by
the duration of the game session, but rather by the existence of
connected clients: as long as there's a client connected, the Web
server needs to be available to service any new requests from the
client.

<p>As we mentioned above, the network protocols we use don't tell us
with certainty whether or not a client is connected.  More precisely,
they don't tell us with certainty that a client is <i>not</i>
connected.  We <i>can</i> tell for sure that a client is connected,
because if we receive a request message, we know that it had to come
from a connected client.  But the absence of any requests doesn't
necessarily mean that there are no clients; it could simply mean that
the client doesn't have any work for us at the moment, or that the
client computer is tied up doing something else before it can issue
its next request, or that a network glitch has temporarily delayed
messages from the client.

<p>The Web UI has a two-pronged approach to dealing with all these
uncertainties.  First, the Javascript portion of the UI uses a
publish/subscribe model to maintain a continuous communication channel
with the server.  The server uses this channel to send periodic
"keepalive" messages to the client when no other messaging activity is
taking place.  This ensures that the client and server exchange
messages with a minimum frequency (about every 90 seconds &mdash; frequently
enough to allow reasonably timely detection of a disconnected client,
but rarely enough that the extra messages won't affect network
performance).  Second, the server monitors client sessions for long
periods of inactivity.  When a client doesn't responds to our
"keepalive" messages for longer than a certain interval (about 60
seconds), we assume that the client has disconnected.  When we haven't
heard from <i>any</i> clients for a certain interval (about 120
seconds), we assume that the player must be finished with the game.
This the point when the program exits and the interpreter terminates.

<p>The timeout intervals mentioned above are nothing magical; they're
just parameters in the Web UI server code, chosen based on practical
experience.  Detecting a disconnection is inherently probabilistic: we
can never be certain a client is never coming back, no matter how long
it's been since we last heard from them, but the longer we go the more
likely it becomes that we have a disconnection rather than something
temporary like a network glitch or client-side CPU bottleneck.  The
practical goal is to choose timeouts that let us shut down the
server-side program as soon as possible when it's no longer needed (so
that the server machine resources aren't tied up longer than
necessary), but no sooner.

<p>Note that when running in <a href="#standalone">local stand-alone
mode</a>, some interpreters maintain a direct connection to the
browser window that allows them to detect when the player closes the
window.  This bypasses the timeouts and allows the game program and
interpreter to terminate immediately when the player closes the
browser window.  This is possible in standalone mode because
everything's running on one machine, which eliminates the
uncertainties of the network configuration and allows the interpreter
to know exactly what's going on with the browser.  The Windows
interpreter provides this feature.



<h2><a name="standalone">Local single-machine (stand-alone) testing</a></h2>

<p>One of the main reasons to create a Web UI game is that it allows
users to play on the Web, without having to download your game or
install software.  However, Web UI games can <i>also</i> be played
without a Web server, a browser, or a network connection.  Most TADS
interpreters let you play a Web UI game in "local" mode, also known as
standalone mode - this means that you run the game on a single
computer without a Web server involved.

<p>You'll probably want to use standalone mode while you're developing
and testing your game, since it would be inconvenient to have to
upload your game to a server every time you recompile.


<a name="debugging"></a><h3>Debugging with Workbench on Windows</h3>

<p>If you're using Workbench on Windows to develop your game,
standalone mode is the default way of running.  When you use the Go
command, Workbench automatically runs the game in standalone mode.
Everything looks just like it does with a traditional console-mode
game.  The only difference is that the game window is actually an
embedded Web browser - but this is all handled invisibly, so you don't
have to worry about launching a browser separately or typing a URL or
anything like that.

<p>As we described <a href="shutdown">earlier</a>, a Web UI game
continues running even after the player types QUIT, so that it can
continue to provide HTTP services as long as the client is connected
(to allow page refreshes, for example).  This can be a little strange
when you're using the debugger.  There are two simple ways to truly
terminate the game program: you can close the game window, or you can
use the Terminate Game command in the debugger.  Closing the game
window triggers a special message to the game program that tells it to
terminate immediately, bypassing the usual timeout intervals that
would otherwise keep the game running for a while longer.  When you
use the Terminate Game command, this directly ends the game program.


<h2><a name="Adv3WebUsageTips">Adv3LiteWeb usage tips</a></h2>

<p>When using the Adv3LiteWeb library, there are some additional things
you should do to make sure your game works correctly.

<h3>Use aHref() for command links</h3>

<p>In HTML TADS games, you can use <span class="code">&lt;A HREF=xxx&gt;</span> to create
clickable command links.  With the Web UI, all HTML is displayed by
a standard Web browser, so the <span class="code">&lt;A HREF&gt;</span> tag has its standard
meaning, which is to create a hyperlink to a separate Web page.

<p>To create a command link, use the Adv3LiteWeb function <span class="code">aHref()</span>:

<p><div class="code"><pre>
"To save the game, type &lt;&lt;aHref('SAVE')&gt;&gt;. "
</pre></div>

<p>You should continue to use <span class="code">&lt;A HREF&gt;</span> for actual hyperlinks,
where the link navigates to another Web page rather than entering
a command, as well as for special links such as <span class="code">mailto:</span> links.

<h3>Don't use <span class="code">&lt;TAB&gt;</span></h3>

<p>The <span class="code">&lt;TAB&gt;</span> tag is an HTML TADS extension that isn't in standard
HTML.  Standard Web browsers don't support it.  Unfortunately,
standard HTML doesn't have a simple equivalent of <span class="code">&lt;TAB&gt;</span>, but you
can usually achieve similar effects using <span class="code">&lt;SPAN&gt;</span> or <span class="code">&lt;DIV&gt;</span> tags
with CSS styling to control spacing.

<h3><a name="inputmanager">Use inputManager methods for input</a></h3>

<p>As we've already mentioned a couple of times, you can't use the
interpreter's built-in functions for input and output.  The built-ins
all operate directly on the local console, which obviously isn't
available to a remote user playing on the Web.

<p>Instead of the interpreter built-ins, always use the  <a name="inputmgr_idx">inputManager</a>
equivalents:

<ul>
   <li>inputManager.getInputLine(promptFunc?) (<i>not</i> inputLine or inputLineTimeout)
   <li>inputManager.getKey(promptFunc?) (<i>not</i> inputKey)
   <li>inputManager.getEventOrKey(promptFunc, keyOnly) (<i>not</i> inputEvent)
   <li>inputManager.getInputFile(prompt, dialogType, fileType, flags) (<i>not</i> inputFile)
   <li>inputManager.getInputDialog(icon, prompt, buttons, defaultButton, cancelButton) (<i>not</i> inputDialog)
   <li>inputManager.pauseForMore() (<i>not</i> morePrompt)
</ul>

<p>The <em>promptFunc</em> parameter can be supplied either as an anonymous function that displays a prompt or simply as a single-quoted string. For <span class="code">getInputLine()</span> and <span class="code">getKey()</span> (or their macro equivalents) this parameter can be omitted altogether; you can simply display a prompt string before calling the method.</p>

<p>For the most common cases you can use the following macros:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>more</strong> expands to <span class="code">inputManager.pauseForMore()</span></li>
<li><strong>input(x)</strong> expands to <span class="code">inputManager.getInputLine(x)</span></li>
<li><strong>waitKey(x)</strong> expands to <span class="code">inputManager.getKey(x)</span></li>
</ul>


<a name="cls"></a><h3>Use <span class="code">cls()</span> instead of <span class="code">clearScreen()</span></h3>

<p>You shouldn't use the built-in function <span class="code">clearScreen()</span>, just
as you shouldn't use any other built-in I/O functions.  Use
<span class="code">cls()</span> instead - this will work correctly in both Adv3 and Adv3web.


<a name="nobanner"></a><h3>Don't use the Banner API</h3>

<p>The Banner API isn't supported in Adv3LiteWeb.  This includes both the
low-level banner functions built into the interpreter and the Adv3Lite
BannerWindow class.

<p>The Web UI provides similar capabilities, but it uses a new
programming interface.  The new system is much more flexible than the
banner API because it uses Javascript and CSS in the client.  This
combination isn't limited to the "tiled" model of the banner API - you
can create overlapping windows, create transparent windows, move
windows dynamically, set sizes using font metrics, etc.  The new
system is so different that it makes more sense to work directly with
the new interfaces, so that you can take better advantage of their new
capabilities.

<p>Note that Adv3LiteWeb <i>does</i> provide the higher-level components
that were built on the banner API in Adv3Lite: the status line, the menu
system, and the hint system.  The Adv3LiteWeb versions of these components
are built directly on the new Javascript front end instead of the
banner API.

<a name="sound"></a><h3>Sound playback</h3>

<p>The <span class="code">&lt;SOUND&gt;</span> tag is an HTML TADS extension that's not in
standard HTML, so you can't use it for sound playback in Web UI
games.

<p>There's currently no support for sound playback in the Web UI
library.  Mike Roberts plans to add this in the future.  For the moment,
if you need sound playback, you'll have to resort to direct
Javascript programming.

<a name="aboutbox"></a><h3><span class="code">&lt;ABOUTBOX&gt;</span></h3>

<p>The <span class="code">&lt;ABOUTBOX&gt;&gt;</span> tag is an HTML TADS extension, not part of
standard HTML.  You shouldn't use this tag.  There's currently no
equivalent in the Web UI.  However, note that the Adv3Lite library
only calls <span class="code">gameMain.setAboutBox()</span> when running in console mode,
so it's fine to write your <span class="code">&lt;ABOUTBOX&gt;</span> code as usual in that
method.
