Adv3Lite Quick Start Guide
</a>
<br>by Eric Eve

<p>This brief guide is probably the best place to start for newcomers to TADS 3
and/or adv3Lite.
It contains instructions for installing the library and compiling a basic game,
an explanation of the other documentation, including guidance on where to go
next, and a sample game newcomers can experiment with if they want to dive
straight in.</p>

Adv3Lite Tutorial
</a>
<br>by Eric Eve

<p>This tutorial introduction is a great starting point for anyone new
to TADS 3 and new to programming.  The book opens with the basics of
getting TADS working on your system and setting up your first simple
game, so even if you've never done any programming before, this will
help you get going quickly.  The tutorial then leads you step by step
through the design of three example games, showing how to use
adv3Lite to implement the effects needed in the game.  By the time you're
done, you'll know your way around the system and you'll be able to
write your own games.

Learning TADS 3 With Adv3Lite
</a>
<br>by Eric Eve

<p>Part tutorial and part reference, <i>Learning TADS 3 With Adv3Lite</i> is a
perfect place to start for confident beginners, and for people with a
little more programming experience.  This book is designed for
learning TADS on your terms - it's organized by functional area, so
once you've mastered the basics, you can skip around to focus on the
areas you're most interested in.  As you develop your game, you can
return to the book as a reference, to review the details of particular
TADS features.</p>

<p><i>Learning TADS 3 With Adv3Lite</i> contains a number of exercises.
Samples games suggesting solutions to some of these exercises may 
be found <a target=_blank href="learning/exercises.htm">here</a>.
Alternatively you can treat these solutions as sample code 
illustrating various aspects of the adv3Lite library.</p>

Introduction to HTML TADS
</a>
<br>by Michael Roberts
 
<p>TADS 3 uses a variant of HTML as its formatting language.  These
notes explain how HTML fits into TADS, and how you can use HTML
formatting codes for text effects, graphics, and sound, and how the
TADS variant differs from standard HTML.  (These are essentially just
the original notes for HTML TADS 2, so they're a little rough, but
they are updated with relevant changes for TADS 3.  Note that this
isn't an HTML tutorial - but the HTML in TADS is pretty close to
standard HTML, so you can learn it from any of the many tutorials on
the Web for ordinary HTML.)
