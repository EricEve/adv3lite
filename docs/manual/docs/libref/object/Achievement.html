   An Achievement is an object used to award points in the score.  For   most purposes, an achievement can be described simply by a string,   but the Achievement object provides more flexibility in describing   combined scores when a set of similar achievements are to be grouped. <p>   There are two ways to use the scoring system. <p>   1.  You can use a mix of string names and Achievement objects for   scoring items; each time you award a scoring item, you call the   function addToScore() to specify the achievement (by name or by   Achievement object) and the number of points to award.  You can also   call the method addToScoreOnce() on an Achievement object to award   the scoring item, ensuring that the item is only awarded once in the   entire game (saving you the trouble of checking to see if the event   that triggered the scoring item has happened before already in the   same game).  If you do this, you MUST set the property   gameMain.maxScore to reflect the maximum score possible in the game. <p>   2.  You can use EXCLUSIVELY Achievement objects to represents scoring   items, and give each Achievement object a 'points' property   indicating the number of points it's worth.  To award a scoring item,   you call the method awardPoints() on an Achievement object.  If you   use this style of scoring, the library AUTOMATICALLY computes the   gameMain.maxScore value, by adding up the 'points' values of all of   the Achievement objects in the game.  For this to work properly, you   have to obey the following rules: <p> <br>   - use ONLY Achievement objects (never strings) to award points; <br>   - set the 'points' property of each Achievement to its score; <br>   - define Achievement objects statically only (never use 'new' to <br>     create an Achievement dynamically) <br>   - if an Achievement can be awarded more than once, you must override <br>     its 'maxPoints' property to reflect the total number of points it <br>     will be worth when it is awarded the maximum number of times; <br>   - always award an Achievement through its awardPoints() or <br>     awardPointsOnce() method; <br>   - there exists at least one solution of the game in which every <br>     Achievement object is awarded

For example, an achievement for   finding various treasure items might want to display "finding a   treasure" if only one treasure was found and "finding five   treasures" if five were found. <p>   In some cases, it might be desirable to keep track of additional   custom information, and use that information in generating the   description.  For example, the game might keep a list of   treasures found with the achievement, adding to the list each   time the achievement is scored, and displaying the contents of   the list when the description is shown. <p>
