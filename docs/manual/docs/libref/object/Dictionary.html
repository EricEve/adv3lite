   The Dictionary intrinsic class is a specialized lookup table class   designed for storing the vocabulary table for a parser.  Dictionary   works closely with GrammarProd to supply the vocabulary tokens for the   productions. <p>   The main difference between Dictionary and a more general hash table is   that Dictionary tags each vocabulary word with a type; for our purposes,   the type is the vocabulary property (&amp;noun, &amp;adjective, etc) that   associates the word with an object.

<table class=decl><tr><td><code>correctSpelling (str, maxEditDistance)</code><td align=right><code><a href="../file/dict.h.html">dict.h</a>[<a href="../source/dict.h.html#224">224</a>]</table><div class=desc>   Get a list of possible spelling corrections for the given word.   This searches the dictionary for words that match the given word   within the given maximum "edit distance". <p>   The return value is a list giving all of the words in the dictionary   that match the input string within the given maximum edit distance.   Any given dictionary word will appear only once in the returned   list.  The list is in arbitrary order.  Each entry consists of a   sublist, [word, dist, repl], where 'word' is a matching dictionary   word, 'dist' is the edit distance between that dictionary word and   the input string, and 'repl' is the number of character replacements   performed.  (The replacement count is included in the edit distance,   but it's called out separately because some correctors treat   replacements as heavier changes than other edits.  A caller could   use this to break ties for corrections of the same distance.   Consider "book" and "box" as corrections for "bok": both have edit   distance 1, but "book" has no replacements, while "box" has one.) <p>   The edit distance between two words is defined as the number of   single-character insertions, deletions, replacements, and   transpositions necessary to transform one word into another.  For   example, OPNE can be transformed into OPEN by transposing the N-E   pair, for an edit distance of 1.  XAEMINE can be transformed into   EXAMINE by inserting an E at the beginning, and then deleting the E   at the third letter, for an edit distance of 2. <p>   Choosing the maximum edit distance is essentially heuristic.  Higher   values make the search take longer, and yield more matches - which   increases the chances that the right match will be found, but also   increases the number of false matches to sift through.  The   literature on spelling correction suggests that 2 is a good value in   practice, across a wide range of applications, based on the most   frequent patterns of human typographical errors.  However, you'll   probably do better to vary the distance based on the word length:   perhaps 1 for words up to 4 letters, 2 for 5-7 letters, and 3 for   words of 8 letters or more. <p>   If the dictionary has a StringComparator object as its current   comparator, the results will take into account its case folding   setting, truncation length, and character mappings.  These   "approximations" are NOT considered to be edits, so they don't count   against the maximum edit distance.  Custom comparators (not of the   StringComparator class) are ignored: if you use a custom comparator,   this method will only find matches based on the exact text of the   dictionary words. <p>

<a name="findWord"></a>
<table class=decl><tr><td><code>findWord (str, voc_prop?)</code><td align=right><code><a href="../file/dict.h.html">dict.h</a>[<a href="../source/dict.h.html#131">131</a>]</table><div class=desc>   Find a word; returns a list giving the objects associated with the   string in the dictionary.  If voc_prop is specified, only objects   associated with the word by the given vocabulary property are   returned.  We match the string using the comparator defined for the   dictionary. <p>   The return value is a list consisting of pairs of entries.  The   first element of each pair is the matching object, and the second is   gives the comparator result for matching the word.  If we use a   StringComparator, this will be a non-zero integer value giving   information on truncation, case folding, and any equivalence   mappings defined in the comparator.  If the comparator is a custom   object, then the second element of the pair will be whatever the   custom comparator's matchValues() method returned for matching the   value for that dictionary entry. <p>   The reason for giving a matchValues() return value for every   individual match is that the same input string 'str' might match   multiple entries in the dictionary.  For example, the same string   might match one word exactly and one with truncation.  The match   result code lets the caller determine if some matches are "better"   than others, based on how the string matched for each individual   object entry. <p>

<a name="forEachWord"></a>
<table class=decl><tr><td><code>forEachWord (func)</code><td align=right><code><a href="../file/dict.h.html">dict.h</a>[<a href="../source/dict.h.html#175">175</a>]</table><div class=desc>   Invoke the callback func(obj, str, prop) for each word in the   dictionary.  Note that the callback can be invoked with a single   string multiple times, since the callback is invoked once per   word/object/property association; in other words, the callback is   invoked once for each association created with addWord() or during   compilation. <p>
</div>
<a name="isWordDefined"></a>
<table class=decl><tr><td><code>isWordDefined (str, filter?)</code><td align=right><code><a href="../file/dict.h.html">dict.h</a>[<a href="../source/dict.h.html#165">165</a>]</table><div class=desc>   Check to see if the given string 'str' is defined in the dictionary.   Returns true if the word is defined, nil if not. <p>   If the 'filter' argument is provided, it gives a callback function   that is invoked to determine whether or not to count a particular   word in the dictionary as a match.  The callback is invoked with one   argument: (filter)(match), where 'match' is the result of the   comparator's matchValues(str,dstr) method, where 'dstr' is a   dictionary string matching 'str'.  The filter function returns true   if the string should be counted as a match, nil if not.  The return   value of isWordDefined thus will be true if the filter function   returns true for at least one match, nil if not.  The purpose of the   filter function is to allow the caller to impose a more restrictive   condition than the dictionary's current comparator does; for   example, the caller might use the filter to determine if the   dictionary contains any matches for 'str' that match without any   truncation. <p>

This   removes only the association for the given object; other objects   associated with the same word are not affected. <p>
</div>
<a name="setComparator"></a>
<table class=decl><tr><td><code>setComparator (compObj)</code><td align=right><code><a href="../file/dict.h.html">dict.h</a>[<a href="../source/dict.h.html#104">104</a>]</table><div class=desc>   Set the comparator object.  This defines how words are compared.   The object must provide the following methods, which comprise the   "comparator" interface.  Note that there's no class that defines   this interface; this is simply a set of methods that we define here,   and which the supplied object must define. <p>   calcHash(str) - returns an integer giving the hash value of the   given string.  The purpose of the hash value is to arbitrarily   partition the search space, so that we can search only a small   subset of the dictionary when looking for a particular string.  It   is desirable for hash values to distribute uniformly for a given set   of strings.  It's also highly desirable for the hash computation to   be inexpensive (i.e., to run fast), since the whole point of the   hash is to reduce the amount of time it takes to find a string; if   it takes longer to compute the hash value than it would to search   every string in the table, then we don't come out ahead using the   hash. <p>   matchValues(inputStr, dictStr) - compare the given input string with   the given dictionary string, and return a result indicating whether   or not they match for the purposes of the comparator.  A return   value of zero or nil indicates that the values do not match; any   other return value indicates a match. <p>   Typically, matchValues() will return a non-zero integer to indicate   a match and to encode additional information about the match using a   bitwise-OR'd combination of flag values.  For example, a comparator   that allows case folding could use bit flag 0x0001 to indicate any   match, and bit flag 0x0002 to indicate a match where the case of one   or more input letters did not match the case of the corresponding   letters in the dictionary string.  So, a return value of 0x0001   would indicate an exact match, and 0x0003 would indicate a match   with case differences. <p>   Note the asymmetry in the matchValues() arguments: we specifically   designate one string as the input string and one as the dictionary   string.  This allows for asymmetrical comparisons, which are   desirable in some cases: we sometimes want a given input string to   match a given dictionary string even when the two are not identical   character-by-character.  For example, we might want to allow the   user to type only the first six or eight characters of a string in   the dictionary, to save typing; or, we might want to allow a user to   enter unaccented letters and still match dictionary words containing   the corresponding letters with accents.  The asymmetry in the   arguments is there because we often only want these "fuzzy" match   rules to work in one direction; for the truncation example, we'd   want an input word that's a truncated version of a dictionary word   to match, but not the other way around. <p>   Important: Note that, although the hash value computation is up to   the implementing object to define, we impose one requirement.  It is   REQUIRED that for any two strings s1 and s2, if matchValues(s1, s2)   indicates a match (i.e., returns a value other than 0 or nil), then   calcHash(s1) MUST EQUAL calcHash(s2).  (This does NOT mean that two   strings with equal hash values must be equal, or, equivalently, that   two unequal strings must have different hash values.  Hash   collisions are explicitly allowed, so two strings that don't match   can still have the same hash value.) <p>
