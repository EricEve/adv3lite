   The Date intrinsic class stores a date-and-time value representing a   particular point in time, and provides methods and operators for date   arithmetic, formatting, and parsing. <p>   The date/time value is stored internally in terms of universal time   (UTC).  This makes it independent of locations and time zones.  When a   new Date object is created for a given calendar day or clock time, that   source value is assumed to be in terms of the local wall clock time of   the machine it's running on, but a different time zone can be explicitly   specified instead; the Date object automatically translates that local   time value to UTC for storage.  Likewise, when a Date is formatted to a   string representation, or when calendar or clock components are   extracted from it, the formatted or extracted value is translated by   default to the local time zone, but a different time zone can be   specified. <p>   You can create a Date object from a number of other representations for   date values: <p> <br>  new Date() - creates a Date representing the current date and time. <p> <br>  new Date('string', refTZ?, refDate?) - parses the string as a date <br>         value.  'refTZ' is an optional TimeZone object; if provided, <br>         the date string will be interpreted as a local time in that <br>         zone, unless the string contains a timezone specifier.  The <br>         default timezone if 'refTZ' is missing is the local system's <br>         time zone.  'refDate' is an optional Date object that's used <br>         to fill in certain missing date elements in the string.  If <br>         the string doesn't specify the year (e.g., 'March 1'), the <br>         year is taken from refDate; if the string only specifies only <br>         a time, the date is taken from refDate.  If the date uses a <br>         two-digit year number ('5/15/92'), the century is inferred <br>         from the reference date by finding the year closest to the <br>         reference year (for example, if it's currently 2012, '92' is <br>         interpreted as 1992, since that's closer to 2012 than is <br>         2092).  The date parser accepts numerous common human-readable <br>         formats and several standard computer formats.  For a full <br>         list of, see the System Manual.  The parser uses the locale <br>         settings from setLocaleInfo() to match month names, weekday <br>         names, etc; the default settings are for US English format. <p> <br>  new Date(number, 'J') - 'number' can be an integer or a BigNumber. <br>         This creates a Date object representing the given number of <br>         days after January 1, 4713 BCE on the Julian calendar, at <br>         noon UTC.  The fractional part is the fraction of a day <br>         past noon; for example, a fractional portion of 0.25 <br>         represents 1/4 of a day, or 6 hours, so it represents a <br>         clock time of 18:00 UTC (6 hours past noon). <p> <br>  new Date(number, 'U') - 'number' can be an integer or a BigNumber. <br>         This creates a Date object representing the given number of <br>         seconds after standard Unix Epoch (1/1/1970 00:00:00 UTC), <br>         or before the Epoch if the value is negative.  If 'number' <br>         is a BigNumber, it can specify fractions of a second, which <br>         the Date object will round to the nearest milliseconds. <br>         This constructor format is provided because "seconds since <br>         1/1/1970" is the standard representation of time on Unix-like <br>         systems, and as a result it's also common in file formats. <p> <br>  new Date(year, month, day, tz?) - midnight on year/month/day (all <br>         given as integers), in the given local time zone 'tz' (given <br>         as a TimeZone object or a string giving a time zone name). <br>         The default time zone if 'tz' is omitted is the system's <br>         local time zone.  The year must be given as the full year <br>         with century, e.g., 2012, not just 12; the latter is valid <br>         but is taken literally as the first-century year 12.  The <br>         month is 1-12 for January to December.  The day is simply <br>         the calendar day of the month (e.g., 5 for January 5).  The <br>         year can zero or negative.  Note that because year 0 is a <br>         valid year in Date's calendar system, negative years are off <br>         by one from the "BC" convention: in the AD/BC convention, <br>         the year before AD 1 is 1 BC, not AD 0; so on our calendar, <br>         year 0 corresponds to 1 BC, -1 is 2 BC, etc. <p> <br>  new Date(year, month, day, hour, minute, seconds, ms, tz?) - the <br>         given date and time value, with each element as an integer. <br>         The value is in terms of the given local time zone 'tz', <br>         or the system's local time zone if 'tz' is omitted.  'ms' <br>         is the number of milliseconds (0-999). <p>   Date arithmetic: the following operators perform calendar calculations   on the date value: <p> <br>  Date + integer   - add days to the date <br>  Date - integer   - subtract days from date <br>  Date + BigNumber - add days (which can include fractional days) <br>  Date - BigNumber - subtract days (which can include fractional days) <br>  Date - Date      - number of days between dates (with fractional days) <p>   Adding an integer or BigNumber returns a new Date object representing   the result; Date objects are immutable, so the original Date value isn't   changed by the operation. <p>   Subtracting one Date from another yields a BigNumber with the difference   in days between the two dates.  Note that this might have a fractional   part, because the difference might not be whole days; for example,   subtracting 13:00 from 19:00 on the same day yields 0.25, which is 1/4   of a 24-hour day, or 6 hours..  Like all Date arithmetic, subtraction   works in universal time, so the subtraction yields the true time   difference between the events even if they were created from times in   different time zones.  For example, subtracting 1 PM Eastern Time from 1   PM Pacific Time on the same day yields 0.125 (1/8 of a day, or 3 hours). <p>   The comparison operators (&lt; &gt; &lt;= &gt;=) compare two Date values by order of   occurrence in time.  For example, a &gt; b is true if a is later than b.   The comparison is done in universal time, so the comparison yields the   actual event order, not the nominal local time order.  For example, 2 PM   Eastern Time is earlier than 1 PM Pacific Time on any given day. <p>   Time zone specifications: when a time zone is specified in a constructor   or method argument, you can supply a TimeZone object, or a string with   the name of a time zone, using the same formats that the TimeZone   constructor accepts.  See the TimeZone object for more information.  The   default if you don't specify a time zone is <p>

The   interval is given as a list of integers: [years, months, days,   hours, minutes, seconds].  The 'seconds' value can be a BigNumber   with a fractional part (but anything smaller than milliseconds is   discarded).  Elements can be omitted from the end of the list; for   example, [0, 2] adds two months.  An element can be negative: [-1]   subtracts one year. <p>

The   same comparisons can be done with the ordinary comparison operators   (&lt;, &gt;, &lt;=, &gt;=, ==, !=), but this is convenient for sorting callbacks   since it lets you get the greater/equal/less result in one shot. <p>

'weekday' is the target weekday to find, as an integer:   1 for Sunday, 2 for Monday, ..., 7 for Saturday.  'which' is an   integer specifying which relative day to find: 1 means to find the   next occurrence of the given weekday on or after this date, 2 means   the second occurrence on or after this date, and so on.  -1 means   the first occurrence on or before this date; -2 is the second   occurrence on or before this date; etc. <p>

Returns a list of integers: [hour,   minute, second, ms].  The hour is on a 24-hour clock, with 0 hours   representing midnight and 23 representing 11 PM.  The 'ms' value is   a value from 0 to 999 giving the milliseconds portion of the time. <p>

Returns a list consisting of   [year, month, day, weekday], each value represented as an integer.   The weekday is 1 for Sunday, 2 for Monday, etc.  For example, June   21, 2012 (a Thursday) is represented as [2012,6,21,5]. <p>

This returns a list with three   elements, [year, week, day], where 'year' is the ISO year number   containing the date, 'week' is the week number (1 to 53), and 'day'   is the day of the week (1-7, Monday to Sunday, per the ISO 8601   conventions).  The year on the ISO week calendar can differ from the   year on the Gregorian calendar for dates during the first and last   week of a year on Gregorian calendar, because year boundaries on the   ISO calendar always occur on week boundaries.  For example, Jan 1,   2005 has the ISO week date 2004-W53-6 - it's part of 2004 on the ISO   week calendar because weeks can't be split across years, so the   entire week belongs to 2004 on the ISO calendar.  This can work in   both directions: Dec 31, 2007 has the ISO week date 2008-W01-1. <p>

This is the number of days since January   1, 4713 BCE on the (proleptic) Julian calendar, at noon UTC.  This   is an important figure in astronomy.  It's also often useful as a   common currency for converting between arbitrary calendars: you   might not be able to find a published formula for converting between   calendar X and calendar Y, but you can almost always find a formula   for converting between any given calendar and the Julian day system. <p>   The return value is a BigNumber value giving the Julian day   corresponding to this Date value, including a fractional part for   the time past noon UTC on that date. <p>   Note that there's no local time zone involved in this calculation,   since the Julian day number is specifically defined in terms of   universal time. <p>
