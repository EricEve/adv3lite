<h1>Adv3Lite Library Reference Manual</h1>
<i>Version 1.5</i>

<p>Welcome to the adv3Lite Library Reference!

<p>This manual is a hyperlinked, cross-referenced index of the alternative TADS 3
Adventure Library, known as adv3Lite.  It also covers the core T3 system
library as well as the T3 VM's intrinsic functions and classes.

<p>This documentation is derived directly from the library source
files, so it contains the most up-to-date information available.  The
narrative descriptions of classes, functions, methods, and so on are
simply transcribed from the comments in the library source code.  As
such, the information here is also available by browsing the library
source directly.  This manual is designed to be easier to navigate
than the library source code, but in some cases the best way to get
the full details on how something works is to go directly to its
implementation.

<h2>Navigation</h2>

<p>The layout you see here consists of four "frame" windows.

<p>The <b>Contents</b> bar lets you select which list you want
to see in the Index panel.  Click a link to bring up a list of
that type of item in the Index panel.

<p>The <b>File Index</b> panel, along the left side just below the
Contents bar, shows a list of all of the source and header files in
the library.  Click on a filename to go to the page for that file.
The <i>classes</i> link next to each file brings up a list of the
file's classes in the Index panel.

<p>The <b>Index</b> panel, on the left side below the File Index,
shows a list of classes, actions, grammar rules, objects, functions,
macros, enums, templates, or messages (i.e. messages defined with
BMsg() or DMsg().  You can change the index shown here by
clicking on a link in the Contents bar at the top.

<p>The main panel shows the detailed documentation for the currently
selected item.  Clicking on an item in the Index panel shows that
item's detail page here.


<h2>Tips</h2>

<p>The <i>all symbols</i> link in the Contents bar brings up a truly
comprehensive index (divided alphabetically, to keep the page sizes
manageable) that includes not only all the types of items listed in
the Contents bar, but also all of the properties and methods defined
throughout the library.  This is an easy way to find out exactly which
classes define a particular property.

<p>Many of the items described in the documentation pages include two
cross-reference links, of the form "FileName [line]". Clicking on the
file name link displays the file documentation. Clicking on the line
number will display a copy of the original source file, at the line
where the item is defined.

<p>This manual is generated mechanically from the library sources, but
the generator program sometimes misses things.  If an item says "no
description available", try looking in the source file (click on the
line number link) - there may be documentation there that the
documentation generator didn't pick up.

</ul>

<h2>Acknowledgments</h2>

<p>Many thanks to Edward L. Stauff, who wrote the program that
generates this manual from the library source files.  Ed's system has
been a huge help to everyone using TADS 3, and indispensable in
creating the official doc set.

<p>The generator program is now maintained by Michael Roberts; please
contact Mike with any comments on this manual or the generator
program.  If you're interested in customizing the generator program,
