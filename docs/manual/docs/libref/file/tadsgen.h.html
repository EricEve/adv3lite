<table class=decl><tr><td><code>abs (num)</code><td align=right><code><a href="../file/tadsgen.h.html">tadsgen.h</a>[<a href="../source/tadsgen.h.html#616">616</a>]</table><div class=desc>   Get the absolute value of a number.  The argument can be an integer   or a BigNumber; the return value is the absolute value of the   argument, and has the same type as the argument.  (The absolute   value of a positive number X (or zero) is X; the absolute value of a   negative number X is -X.) <p>
</div>
<a name="concat"></a>
<table class=decl><tr><td><code>concat (...)</code><td align=right><code><a href="../file/tadsgen.h.html">tadsgen.h</a>[<a href="../source/tadsgen.h.html#640">640</a>]</table><div class=desc>   Concatenate the arguments together into a single string.  The   arguments can be strings or any types that can be automatically   converted to string for the regular "+" operator; non-strings are   first converted to strings using the same rules that "+" uses when   combining a string with a non-string.  If there are no arguments,   the result is an empty string. <p>   This function is essentially the same as concatenating a series of   values with the "+" operator, but it's more efficient with three or   more values, since the "+" operator has to be applied successively   in pairs; that creates and copies an extra intermediate result   string at each step.  This function only creates one result string   and only has to copy each input string once. <p>
</div>
<a name="dataType"></a>
<table class=decl><tr><td><code>dataType (val)</code><td align=right><code><a href="../file/tadsgen.h.html">tadsgen.h</a>[<a href="../source/tadsgen.h.html#24">24</a>]</table><div class=desc>   Get the type of the given value.  This returns a TypeXxx value. <p>

If 'cls' is provided, we return the   first object of the given class; otherwise we return the first   object of any kind.  'flags' is an optional bitwise combination of   ObjXxx values, specifying whether classes, instances, or both are   desired.  If this isn't specified, ObjAll is assumed.  This is used   in conjunction with nextObj() to iterate over all objects in memory,   or all objects of a given class. <p>   Note that firstObj-nextObj loops can retrieve objects that aren't   otherwise reachable, because unreachable objects are only removed   from memory when the garbage collector runs, which happens   intermittently.  If you want to ensure that any currently   unreachable objects are removed from memory just before a   firstObj-nextObj loop, you can do so by calling t3RunGC(). <p>
</div>
<a name="getArg"></a>

'idx' is 1 for the   first argument in left-to-right order, 2 for the second, and so on. <p>
</div>
<a name="getFuncParams"></a>
<table class=decl><tr><td><code>getFuncParams (func)</code><td align=right><code><a href="../file/tadsgen.h.html">tadsgen.h</a>[<a href="../source/tadsgen.h.html#542">542</a>]</table><div class=desc>   Get a description of the parameters to the given function.  'func'   is a function pointer.  This function returns a list: [minArgs,   optionalArgs, isVarargs], where minArgs is the minimum number of   arguments required by the function, optionalArgs is the additional   number of arguments that can be optionally provided to the function,   and isVarargs is true if the function takes any number of additional   ("varying") arguments, nil if not. <p>
</div>
<a name="getTime"></a>
<table class=decl><tr><td><code>getTime (timeType?)</code><td align=right><code><a href="../file/tadsgen.h.html">tadsgen.h</a>[<a href="../source/tadsgen.h.html#318">318</a>]</table><div class=desc>   Get the current local time. <p>   If timeType is GetTimeDateAndTime (or is omitted), this returns the   calendar date and wall-clock time, as a list: [year, month,   dayOfMonth, dayOfWeek, dayOfYear, hour, minute, second, timer].   Year is the year AD (for example, 2006); month is the current month,   from 1 (January) to 12 (December); dayOfMonth is the calendar day of   the month, from 1 to 31; dayOfWeek is the day of the week, from 1   (Sunday) to 7 (Saturday); dayOfYear is the current day of the year,   from 1 (January 1) to 366 (December 31 in a leap year); hour is the   hour on a 24-hour clock, ranging from 0 (midnight) to 23 (11pm);   minute is the minute of the hour, from 0 to 59; second is the second   of the minute, from 0 to 59; and timer is the number of seconds   elapsed since the "Epoch," defined as midnight, January 1, 1970,   midnight UTC.  (This is the Epoch that Unix-like systems use, so it   appears frequently in computer timekeeping systems.)  See the Date   class for more comprehensive date/time handling. <p>   If timeType is GetTimeTicks, this return the number of milliseconds   since an arbitrary starting time.  The first call to get this   information sets the starting time, so it will return zero;   subsequent calls will return the amount of time elapsed from that   starting time.  Note that because a signed 32-bit integer can only   hold values up to about 2 billion, the maximum elapsed time that   this value can represent is about 24.8 days; so, if your program   runs continuously for more than this, the timer value will roll   around to zero at each 24.8 day multiple.  So, it's possible for   this function to return a smaller value than on a previous   invocation, if the two invocations straddle a 24.8-day boundary. <p>

If the repeat count isn't specified, the default is 1; a   repeat count less than zero throws an error.  'val' can be any   value; it's simply repeated in each element of the list. <p>
</div>
<a name="makeString"></a>
<table class=decl><tr><td><code>makeString (val, repeatCount?)</code><td align=right><code><a href="../file/tadsgen.h.html">tadsgen.h</a>[<a href="../source/tadsgen.h.html#531">531</a>]</table><div class=desc>   Create a string by repeating the given value the given number of   times.  If the repeat count isn't specified, the default is 1; a   repeat count less than zero throws an error.  'val' can be a string,   in which case the string is simply repeated the given number of   times; an integer, in which case the given Unicode character is   repeated; or a list of integers, in which case the given Unicode   characters are repeated, in the order of the list.  The list format   can be used to create a string from a list of Unicode characters   that you've been manipulating as a character array, which is   sometimes a more convenient or efficient way to do certain types of   string handling than using the actual string type. <p>

<a name="max"></a>

The values must be   comparable with the ordinary "&lt;" and "&gt;" operators.  Note that   because this is an ordinary function call, all of the arguments are   evaluated (which means any side effects of these evaluations will be   triggered). <p>

The values must be   comparable with the ordinary "&lt;" and "&gt;" operators.  Note that   because this is an ordinary function call, all of the arguments are   evaluated (which means any side effects of these evaluations will be   triggered). <p>

<a name="nextObj"></a>
<table class=decl><tr><td><code>nextObj (obj, cls?, flags?)</code><td align=right><code><a href="../file/tadsgen.h.html">tadsgen.h</a>[<a href="../source/tadsgen.h.html#56">56</a>]</table><div class=desc>   Get the next object in memory after the given object, optionally of   the given class and optionally limiting to instances, classes, or   both.  This is used to continue an iteration started with   firstObj(). <p>
</div>
<a name="rand"></a>
<table class=decl><tr><td><code>rand (...)</code><td align=right><code><a href="../file/tadsgen.h.html">tadsgen.h</a>[<a href="../source/tadsgen.h.html#219">219</a>]</table><div class=desc>   Select a random number or a random value.  This uses the current   random number algorithm as selected via randomize(). <p>   If no arguments are supplied, the result is a random integer   distributed evenly over the full range of the 32-bit integer type.   The result can be positive or negative. <p>   If exactly one argument is supplied, the result depends on the type   of the argument: <p>   - Integer: the function returns an integer from 0 to one less than   the argument value.  For example, rand(10) returns a number from 0   to 9 inclusive. <p>   - List: the function randomly selects one of the values from the   list and returns it. <p>   - String: the function generates a random string by replacing each   character of the argument string with a randomly chosen character,   selected from a specific range specified by the argument character.   For example, each 'a' in the input string is replaced by a random   lower-case letter from a to z, each 'A' is replaced by a capital   letter, and each 'd' is replaced by a random digit 0 to 9.  See the   System Manual for the full list of the character codes. <p>   If more than one argument is supplied, the function randomly selects   one of the arguments and returns it.  Note that this is an ordinary   function call, so all of the arguments are evaluated, triggering any   side effects of those evaluations. <p>   In all cases, the random numbers are uniformly distributed, meaning   that each possible return value has equal probability. <p>
</div>
<a name="randomize"></a>
<table class=decl><tr><td><code>randomize (...)</code><td align=right><code><a href="../file/tadsgen.h.html">tadsgen.h</a>[<a href="../source/tadsgen.h.html#183">183</a>]</table><div class=desc>   Random number generator (RNG) initialization.  This selects and   initializes the random number generator algorithm used by rand().   TADS provides several different RNG algorithms; each RNG has   different properties, so some applications might have reasons to   prefer a particular algorithm.  For general purposes, any of them   should produce good results. <p>   The interpreter automatically makes a call to randomize() (the   no-arguments version) when it starts up, unless the user specifies   the "-norand" option when launching the interpreter.  For most   programs, this means that you'll never have to make your own call to   randomize() - you can just call rand() when you need random numbers. <p>   This function performs several tasks, depending on how you invoke   it: <p> <br>   randomize() - selects the default RNG algorithm (ISAAC), and seeds <br>         the RNG with truly random data from the operating system. <p> <br>   randomize(nil) - retrieves the current state of the RNG.  Returns <br>         a list: [id, state], where 'id' is the ID of the currently <br>         selected RNG algorithm, and 'state' is a value containing <br>         its internal state, which can be used in a later call to <br>         randomize([id, state]) to restore the RNG state.  The 'state' <br>         value is opaque, meaning that it's not meant to be used <br>         directly; the only thing you should do with it it save it <br>         for later if you should want to restore this state later. <p> <br>   randomize([id, state]) - if you pass in a list that obtained from <br>         an earlier call to randomize(nil), the RNG will be returned <br>         to its state at the time of the randomize(nil) call.  This <br>         selects the same RNG algorithm that was in effect then and <br>         restores the internal state of the generator.  After calling <br>         this, a series of calls to rand() will return the same <br>         sequence of numbers that were returned after the call to <br>         randomize(nil). <p> <br>   randomize(id) - selects the RNG algorithm identified by 'id' <br>         (an RNG_Xxx value).  This doesn't change the state of <br>         the generator; it simply selects the algorithm. <p> <br>   randomize(id, nil) - selects the RNG algorithm identified by <br>         'id' (an RNG_Xxx value), and seeds the generator with <br>         truly random data obtained from the operating system. <p> <br>   randomize(id, val) - selects the RNG algorithm identified by <br>         'id' (an RNG_Xxx value), and seeds the generator with <br>         the initial value 'val'.  This can be either an integer <br>         value or a string; the preferred format varies by <br>         algorithm, but they'll all accept either format.  After <br>         you set a given seed value, rand() will return a sequence <br>         of numbers that's repeatable every time you set the same <br>         seed value.  This can be useful for things like testing, <br>         where you want a sequence of numbers that's statistically <br>         random, but which can be reproduced on demand. <p>   Most programs that require random numbers want a truly unpredictable   series of numbers - that is, numbers that have a statistically   random distribution, with no discernible patterns, and which will be   different every time the program is run.  There are two separate   parts to this proposition, and they're handled by separate   functions.  rand() fulfills the first part: it uses a mathematical   formula to generate a series of numbers that are statistically   distributed in a random fashion (for example, so that "1" occurs as   often as "10" or any other number, any given sequence of 2, 3, or   more numbers is equally likely, and so on: mathematicians have many   formal tests that RNGs must satisfy to be considered random.)   randomize() fulfills the second part, which is making sure that the   sequence of numbers is different every time you run the program.   The reason this second part is important is that rand() is by its   nature deterministic: it's defined entirely in terms of a formula,   so given the same initial conditions, it'll always crank out the   same sequence of numbers.  The trick is to randomize its initial   conditions - and what makes it tricky is that we can't just turn to   rand(), since it's the thing we're trying to randomize! <p>   This is where the "seed" values come in.  randomize() and   randomize(id, nil) ask the operating system for truly random data to   use for the initial conditions.  The degree of entropy in this OS   seed data varies by system; some systems have better entropy sources   than others.  But whatever the source, the seed data should be   different each time you run the program.  randomize() feeds this   seed data into the RNG to set its initial conditions, so each time   you run, rand() will be starting from a different initial state.   This makes for a different series of numbers from rand() on each   run. <p>   Note that it's not necessary (or desirable) to call randomize()   every time you want a random number.  Once you seed the RNG, rand()   is all you need to call.  It can be slow to gather the true random   data that randomize() uses, since this sometimes requires   interacting with hardware devices or scanning large amounts of   system data.  rand() is quite fast, since it just calculates a   number using a formula.  Depending on the system, rand() might also   be more reliable at producing high volumes of statistically random   data than the OS sources.  The operating system sources of true   entropy don't always change quickly, so it's better to use them   infrequently, such as just once at the start of program execution,   than to use them as a routine source of random numbers. <p>   The fixed seed values, with randomize(id, val), do something a   little different.  Rather than making the RNG produce different   sequences on each run, a fixed seed makes rand() generate the same   series of numbers every time.  The numbers will still be   statistically random, but each time you run the program, you'll get   the same seaquence.  (The sequence is a function of the seed value.   You'll get a different sequence for each different seed value.) <p>   Why would you want a fixed series of rand() results?  One big reason   is testing.  One popular way to test software is regression testing,   where you run the program and compare its output to a reference   version that you know is correct.  If there are no differences, you   know that changes you've made to the program since haven't broken   anything in the test script.  Randomization interferes with this   kind of testing, because it makes the output different on each run -   it's useless to do a simple mechanical comparison of the new and old   output because they'll always differ.  Fixed seeds to the rescue.   Using a fixed seed, you can still exercise the program's random   behavior, but the sequence of random behavior will repeat on every   run, so you run those regression comparisons after all.  The really   great thing is that you don't have to make big changes to the   program if you want to switch between test mode and real randomness   - all you have to do is change the one call to randomize(). <p>

This can be called after a   successful rexMatch() or rexSearch() call to retrieve information on   the substring that matched the given "group" within the regular   expression.  A group is a parenthesized sub-pattern within the   regular expression; groups are numbered left to right by the open   parenthesis, starting at group 1.  If there is no such group in the   last regular expression searched or matched, or the group wasn't   part of the match (for example, because it was part of an   alternation that wasn't matched), the return value is nil.  If the   group is valid and was part of the match, the return value is a   list: [index, length, string], where index is the character index   within the matched or searched string of the start of the group   match, length is the character length of the group match, and string   is the text of the group match. <p>

'pat' can be either   a string giving the regular expression, or can be a RexPattern   object.  'str' is the string to match, and 'index' is the starting   character index (the first character is at index 1) at which to   start matching.  Returns the length in characters of the match, or   nil if the string doesn't match the pattern.  (Note that a return   value of zero doesn't indicate failure - rather, it indicates a   successful match of the pattern to zero characters.

In this case, we'll search for each of the patterns and replace each   one with the corresponding replacement text.  If the replacement is   itself given a list in this case, each element of the pattern list   is replaced by the corresponding element of the replacement list.   If there are more patterns than replacements, the extra patterns are   replaced by empty strings; any extra replacements are simply   ignored.  If the replacement is a single value rather than a list,   each pattern is replaced by that single replacement value. <p>   'flags' is a combination of the ReplaceXxx bit flags, using '|'.  If   the flags include ReplaceAll, all occurrences of the pattern are   replaced; otherwise only the first occurrence is replaced. <p>   ReplaceOnce and ReplaceAll are mutually exclusive; they mean,   respectively, that only the first occurrence of the match should be   replaced, or that every occurrence should be replaced.  ReplaceOnce   and ReplaceAll are ignored if a 'limit' value is specified (this is   true even if 'limit' is nil, which means that all occurrences are   replaced). <p>   If ReplaceIgnoreCase is included, the capitalization of the match   pattern is ignored, so letters in the pattern match both their   upper- and lower-case equivalents.  Otherwise the case will be   matched exactly. If ReplaceFollowCase AND ReplaceIgnoreCase are   included, lower-case letters in the replacement text are capitalized   as needed to follow the capitalization pattern of the actual text   matched: if all the letters in the match are lower-case, the   replacement is lower case; if all are upper-case, the replacement is   changed to all upper-case; if there's a mix of cases in the match,   the first letter of the replacement is capitalized and the rest are   left in lower-case. <p>   The ReplaceSerial flag controls how the search proceeds when   multiple patterns are specified.  By default, we search for each one   of the patterns, and replace the leftmost match.  If ReplaceOnce is   specified, we're done; otherwise we continue by searching again for   all of the patterns, this time in the remainder of the string (after   that first replacement), and again we replace the leftmost match.   This proceeds until we can't find any more matches for any of the   patterns.  If ReplaceSerial is included in the flags, we start by   searching only for the first pattern, replacing one or all   occurrences depending on the ReplaceOnce or ReplaceAll flag.  Next,   if ReplaceAll is specified OR we didn't find any matches for the   first pattern, we start over with the result and search for the   second pattern, replacing one or all occurrences of it.  We repeat   this for each pattern. <p>   If the flags are omitted entirely, the default is ReplaceAll (which   means replace all occurrences, exact case matches only, parallel   searching). <p>   'index', if provided, is the starting character index of the search;   instances of the pattern before this index will be ignored.  Returns   the result string with all of the desired replacements.  When an   instance of the pattern is found and then replaced, the replacement   string is not rescanned for further occurrences of the text, so   there's no danger of infinite recursion; instead, scanning proceeds   from the next character after the replacement text. <p>   'limit', if specified, is an integer indicating the maximum number   of matches to replace, or nil to replace all matches.  If the limit   is reached before all matches have been replaced, no further   replacements are performed.  If this parameter is specified, it   overrides any ReplaceOnce or ReplaceAll flag. <p>   The replacement text can use "%n" sequences to substitute group   matches from the input into the output.  %1 is replaced by the match   to the first group, %2 the second, and so on.  %* is replaced by the   entire matched input.  (Because of the special meaning of "%", you   must use "%%" to include a percent sign in the replacement text.) <p>

'pat' is a string giving the regular expression to find, or a   RexPattern object.  'str' is the string to search, and 'index' is   the optional starting index (the first character is at index 1;   negative indices are from the end of the string, so -1 is the last   character, -2 is the second to last, and so on).  If a match to the   pattern isn't found, returns nil.  If a match is found, the return   value is a list: [index, length, string], where index is the   starting character index of the match, length is the length in   characters of the match, and string is the text of the match. <p>

'pat' is a string giving the regular expression   to find, or a RexPattern object.  'str' is the string to search, and   'index' is the optional starting index (the first character is at   index 1; negative indices are from the end of the string, so -1 is   the last character, -2 is the second to last, and so on; 0 means the   position just after the last character of the string).  If 'index'   is omitted, the default is to search the entire string from the end,   which is equivalent to passing 0 or str.length()+1 for 'index'. <p>   If a match is found, the return value is a list: [index, length,   string], where index is the starting character index of the match,   length is the length in characters of the match, and string is the   text of the match. <p>   This does the same work as rexSearch(), but searches the string   backwards, from the end to the start.  The match must end before the   starting index, which allows for repeated searches: simply pass the   match index from the previous search as the 'index' value for the   next search to find the next earlier match that doesn't overlap the   previous match. <p>   The meanings of the &lt;FirstBegin&gt; and &lt;FirstEnd&gt; flags for a reverse   search are essentially the mirror image of their meanings in a   regular forward search.  This is easiest to understand by thinking   about the flags in the abstract.  &lt;FirstBegin&gt; means that the   winning match is the one whose "near" endpoint is closest to the   starting index; &lt;FirstEnd&gt; means that the winner is the match whose   "far" endpoint is closest to the starting index.  The near endpoint   in a forward search is the start of the match, whereas it's the end   of the match in a reverse search.  Similarly, the far endpoint is   the end of the match in a forward search and the start of the match   in a reverse search.  So in a reverse search, &lt;FirstBegin&gt; means   that the winner is the match whose ending index is highest, and   &lt;FirstEnd&gt; means that the winner is the one whose starting index is   highest. <p>

This is similar to the traditional C   language "printf" family of functions: it takes a "format string"   containing a mix of plain text and substitution parameters, and a   set of values to plug in to the substitution parameters, and returns   a new string containing the formatted result. <p>   'format' is the format string.  Most characters of the format string   are simply copied verbatim to the result.  However, each '%' in the   format string begins a substitution parameter; the '%' is followed   by one or more optional qualifiers, then by a type code letter.  The   corresponding value from the argument list is formatted into a   string according to the type code, and then replaces the entire '%'   sequence in the result string.  By default, the first '%' parameter   corresponds to the first additional argument after 'format', the   second '%' corresponds to the second additional argument, and so on.   You can override the default argument position of a '%' using the   '$' qualifier - see below. <p>   The arguments following 'format' are the values to be substituted   for the '%' parameters in the format string. <p>   The return value is a string containing the formatted result. <p>   See the System Manual for the list of '%' codes. <p>

If   'val' is nil, or the string 'nil', the return value is 0.  Leading   and trailing spaces are ignored for these strings. <p>   If 'val' is a BigNumber value, the value is rounded to the whole   number, and returned as an integer value.  A numeric overflow error   occurs if the number is out of range for a 32-bit integer.

This is similar to   toInteger(), but can parse strings containing floating point numbers   and whole numbers too large for ordinary integers. <p>   If 'val' is an integer or BigNumber value, the return value is   simply 'val'. <p>   If 'val' is a string, the function parses the string's contents as a   number in the given 'radix', which can be any integer from 2 to 36.   If 'radix' is omitted, the default is 10 for decimal.  If the radix   is decimal, and the number contains a decimal point (a period, '.')   or an exponent (which consists of the letter 'e' or 'E', an optional   '+' or '-' sign, and one or more digits), the value is parsed as a   floating point number, and a BigNumber value is returned.  For any   other radix, decimal points and exponents are considered non-number   characters.  For an integral value, the result will be an integer if   the number is within the range that fits in an integer, otherwise   the result is a BigNumber.  The routine will simply stop parsing at   the first non-number character it encounters, so no error will occur   if the string contains text following the number.  If the text   doesn't contain any number characters at all, the result is zero. <p>   If val is true or the string 'true', return 1; if nil or the string   'nil', returns 0.

'val' can be an   integer, in which case it's converted to a string representation in   the numeric base given by 'radix' (which can be any value from 2 to   36), or base 10 (decimal) if 'radix' is omitted; nil or true, in   which case the string 'nil' or 'true' is returned; a string, which   is returned unchanged; or a BigNumber, in which case the number is   converted to a string representation in the given radix; a list or   vector, in which case the individual elements are converted   recursively, then the results concatenated together into a string   with commas separating elements; or any of the built-in object types   with default string conversions (ByteArray, StringBuffer, FileName,   Date, TimeZone, FileName, etc). <p>   Note that when working with BigNumber values, you might prefer to   use BigNumber.formatString(), as that gives you more control over   the formatting style. <p>   'radix' is only meaningful with numeric values (integers and   BigNumbers).  For BigNumbers, only whole integer values can be   displayed in a non-decimal radix; if the number has a fractional   part, the radix will be ignored and the number will be shown in   decimal. <p>   'isSigned' indicates whether or not the value should be treated as   "signed", meaning that negative values are represented with a "-"   sign followed by the absolute value.  If 'isSigned' is nil, a   negative value won't be converted to its absolute value before being   displayed, but will instead be re-interpreted within its type system   as an unsigned value.  For regular integers, this means that the   result depends on the native hardware storage format for negative   integers.  Most modern hardware uses two's complement notation,   which represents -1 as 0xFFFFFFFF, -2 as 0xFFFFFFFE, etc.  Most   types other than integer don't have distinct signed and unsigned   interpretations, so 'isSigned' isn't meaningful with most other   types.  With BigNumber in particular, the only effect is to omit the   "-" sign for negative values. <p>

A   nil return means that there's no further UNDO information recorded,   which could be because the program has already undone everything   back to the start of the session, or because the UNDO log was   truncated due to memory size such that no savepoints are recorded.   (The system automatically limits the UNDO log's total memory   consumption, according to local system parameters.
