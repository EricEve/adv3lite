<h1>Thoughts</h1>
<p>The thought.t module provides a framework for responding to commands of the form THINK ABOUT WHATEVER. It uses precisely the same TopicEntry mechanism as the Consultable/ConsultTopic classes, and can be used in almost precisely the same way. All you need to do is to define an object of the <b>ThoughtManager</b> class and then populate it with <b>Thought</b> objects, like so:</p>


<p><div class=code><pre>
myThoughts: ThoughtManager
;

+ Thought @george
    "To be honest, you're not really sure what he's doing here. "
;

+ Thought @tFire
    "It's a wretched nuiscance. Your nephew's probably to blame for it
    somehow, but the important thing right now is just to escape from it. "
;

+ DefaultThought
    "You find your thoughts start to wander; for some reason you can't
    concentrate on that topic right now. "
;
</pre></div>

<p>Thought inherits from <a href="topicentry.htm">TopicEntry</a>, so you can use all the properties and methods of TopicEntry with it; Thought and DefaultThought work just like ConsultTopic and DefaultConsultTopic.</p>

<p>You can exclude thoughts.t if you don't want to implement a THINK ABOUT command (or you don't want to implement it this way), but if you include thoughts.t you must also include topicentry.t.</p>
