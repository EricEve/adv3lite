<h1>Room Descriptions</h1>

<p>In a typical room description (which occurs when the player character enters a new room or enters an explicit LOOK command), provided there's enough light, the player will see the room name (usually in bold) followed by a description of the room itself, followed by a listing of the items the room contains. This item listing typically contains four parts (although not all these parts are necessarily present in every room listing):</p>

<ol>
<li>A paragraph for each item with a specialDesc or initSpecialDesc (where useSpecialDesc or useInitSpecialDesc is true).</li>
<li>A list of miscellaneous items (for which lookListed is true).</li>
<li>Lists of the visible contents of any objects in the room.</li>
<li>A paragraph for each NPC (non-player character) present in the room.</li>
</ol>

<p>(If the room belongs to a <a href="senseregion.htm">SenseRegion</a>, then this list will be complicated by the listing of items in other rooms in the SenseRegion, but we'll ignore that complication for now).</p>

<p>We have some control over the order in which the items appear within each of these sections by using the following properties:</p>
<a name="descorder"></a>
<ul>
<li><strong>listOrder</strong>: (integer) controls the order in which miscellaneous items appear in the second part of the listing; the higher the number, the later the item will appears relative to any others in this list.</li>
<li><strong>specialDescBeforeContents</strong>: (true or nil) determines whether the specialDesc or initSpecialDesc appears before the miscellaneous items (i.e. at stage one, the default for most Things) or after (i.e. at stage 4, the default for Actors/NPCs).</li>
<li><strong>specialDescOrder</strong>: (integer) determines the relative order of the specialDesc or initSpecialDesc within stage 1 or 4.</li>
<li><strong>listWith</strong>: can be used to assign items to one or more <a href='lister.htm#grouping'>ListGroups</a> to group them with related items.</li>
<li><strong>lookListed</strong>: (true or nil) determines whether or not this item is included in the list of miscellaneous items at stages 2 and 3. By default lookListed takes its value from isListed which in turn takes its value from !isFixed (i.e. portable items are listed and non-portable ones aren't). Note that this property has no effect for items with an active specialDesc or initSpecialDesc.</li>
<li><strong>contentsListedInLook</strong>: (true or nil) determines whether this item's contents (if any) are listed when showing a room description. By default contentsListedInLook takes its value from contentsListed, which is true by default.</li>
<li><strong>pcListedInLook</strong>: (true or nil) determines whether the Player Character is listed as being in/on this item (if indeed the PC is so), e.g. "You are on the old chair", when showing a room description. By default pcListedInLook takes its value from contentsListedInLook which takes its value from contentsListed, which is true by default.</li>
</ul>

<p>Thus, for example, suppose we had a room defined along the following lines:</p>

 <p><div class="code"><pre>
study: Room 'Study' 'study'   
    "This is your favourite room in the whole house, where you do your best
    work, think your best thoughts, and read your best books. The way out is to
    the north. "
    
    north = hall
    out asExit(north)
    
    west = "Unfortunately you can't get the window open. "
    
    regions = downstairs
;


+ desk: Thing 'desk; fine old'
    "It's a fine old desk with a single drawer. "
    
    specialDesc = "A fine old desk stands in the middle of the room. "
    
    isFixed = true
    cannotTakeMsg = 'The desk is too heavy for one person to move around. '
    
    contType = On
    
    remapIn = deskDrawer   
;

++ redBox: Thing 'red box; small'
    "It's a smallish box you keep odds and ends in. "
    
    isOpenable = true
    isOpen = nil
    isLocked = true
    lockability = lockableWithKey
    contType = In
    
    bulk = 3
    bulkCapacity = 3
    
    lockedMsg = '\^&lt;&lt;theNameIs&gt;&gt; locked; you keep it that way to stop thieving
        little hands pinching your odds and ends. '
    
   
;

+++ battery: Thing 'battery' 
    bulk = 1    
;

++ deskDrawer: Thing 'drawer; desk' 
    contType = In
    isOpenable = true
    isOpen = nil
    isFixed = true
    
    bulkCapacity = 6
    maxSingleBulk = 3
;

+++ brownFile: Thing 'brown file; large brown; manuscript'
    "The file contains the manuscript of an exceedingly boring book a colleague
    sent you to read so you can offer your comments on it. Frankly if it
    perished in the flames that threaten to engulf your house you wouldn't
    regard it as much of a loss. "
    
    hiddenUnder = [silverKey]
    
    dobjFor(Open) asDobjFor(Read)
    
    readDesc = "Flicking through the file for ten seconds is enough to remind
        you why this rubbish would be best consigned to the flames. "
      
;
</pre></div>

<p>Suppose further that an NPC called George follows the player character into the room, and the player character opens the desk drawer, drops a couple of objects, and then executes a LOOK command. The player would then see something like this:</p>


<p><div class="cmdline"><pre>
<strong>Study</strong>
This is your favourite room in the whole house, where you do your best work, think your best thoughts, 
and read your best books. The way out is to the north. 

A fine old desk stands in the middle of the room. 

You can see a note and a blue ball here.

On the desk you see a blue book and a red box.

In the drawer you see a brown file.

George is watching you carefully, waiting for you to speak.
</pre></div>

<p>This is okay, insofar as it gets the job done by telling the player what s/he needs to know about the room's contents, but it's not terribly elegant, not least because the contents of the desk and its drawer are separated from the mention of the desk, and also, arguably, because there's a threefold repetition of "you see". The adv3Lite library provides a number of tools that let you customize this output further.</p>
<a name="mentioned"></a>
<p>The key point to note is that at the start of a room description every item in scope has its <strong>mentioned</strong> property reset to nil. As each item is mentioned in the room description its mentioned property is set to true. Once mentioned is true, the item won't be listed again, even if it has a specialDesc or initSpecialDesc or it would otherwise have appeared in a list of miscellaneous items or contents. We can take advantage of this to mention an item manually before the room lister would otherwise do so, and describe it in any way we please. To help us do that the adv3Lite provides the following embedded expressions we can use in various description properties to preempt the way the library would otherwise have listed things:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>&lt;&lt;mention a obj&gt;&gt;</strong> (or &lt;&lt;mention an obj&gt;&gt;): displays the aName of <em>obj</em> and sets obj.mentioned to true.</li>
<li><strong>&lt;&lt;mention the obj&gt;&gt;</strong>: displays the theName of <em>obj</em> and sets obj.mentioned to true. </li>
<li><strong>&lt;&lt;list of lst&gt;&gt;</strong>: displays the aName of every item in <em>lst</em> (properly formatted as a list) and sets all their mentioned properties to true.</li>
<li><strong>&lt;&lt;list of lst is&gt;&gt;</strong>: as for &lt;&lt;list of lst&gt;&gt; except that the list is followed by the appropriate form of the verb 'to be' (e.g. 'is', 'are', 'was' or 'were' depending on number and tense).</li>
<li><strong>&lt;&lt;is list of lst&gt;&gt;</strong>: as for &lt;&lt;list of lst&gt;&gt; except that the list is preceded by the appropriate form of the verb 'to be' (e.g. 'is', 'are', 'was' or 'were' depending on number and tense).</li>
<li><strong>&lt;&lt;the list of lst&gt;&gt;</strong>: as for &lt;&lt;list of lst&gt;&gt; except that the list displays the theName of every item in <em>lst</em>.</li>
<li><strong>&lt;&lt;exclude obj&gt;&gt;</strong>: marks <em>obj</em> as mentioned so that it will be excluded from the room listing. This might be used, for example, when a custom description already refers to the object, perhaps by something other than its standard name. <em>Obj</em> can be either a single object or a list of object.</li>
</ul>

<p>The first three of these can be immediately followed by the <em>{prev}</em> tag to make any verb that follows agree, for example <span class="code">"\^&lt;&lt;list of contents&gt;&gt; {prev} {lie} strewn across the desk. "</span></p>

<p>Armed with these tools we can, for example, amend the specialDesc of the desk so that the desk lists its contents in any way we please. For example:</p>

 <p><div class="code"><pre>
+ desk: Thing 'desk; fine old'
    "It's a fine old desk with a single drawer. "
    

    specialDesc = &quot;A fine old desk stands in the middle of the room&lt;&lt; if
          listableContents.length &gt; 0 &gt;&gt;, bearing 
        &lt;&lt;list of listableContents&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;end&gt;&gt;. &lt;&lt;if deskDrawer.isOpen &amp;&amp;
          deskDrawer.listableContents.length &gt; 0&gt;&gt; Its drawer is open and
        contains &lt;&lt;list of deskDrawer.listableContents&gt;&gt;. &quot;
    
    isFixed = true
    cannotTakeMsg = 'The desk is too heavy for one person to move around. '
        
    contType = On
    
    remapIn = deskDrawer    
;
</pre></div>

<p>Which would give us:</p>

<p><div class="cmdline"><pre>
<strong>Study</strong>
This is your favourite room in the whole house, where you do your best work, think your best thoughts, 
and read your best books. The way out is to the north. 

A fine old desk stands in the middle of the room, bearing a red box and a blue book. Its drawer is open and contains a brown file. 

You can see a note and a blue ball here.

George is watching you carefully, waiting for you to speak.
</pre></div>

<p>Note how the desk's specialDesc has to test whether there's anything on the desk or in its drawer available for listing before displaying the appropriate text. Note in particular the use of the <strong>listableContents</strong> property for this purpose; if we just used contents the drawer would be shown as lying on top of the desk. Its thus a bit more work to get this right than to allow the library to perform its default listing, but the gain is much greater control over how some items are listed.</p>

<p>Finally, note that this works because the &lt;&lt;list of &gt;&gt; embedded expressions set the mentioned property of the desk's contents before the library would otherwise have listed them, so that they're no longer available for listing by the time the default routine gets round to them. It wouldn't have worked if we'd used these expressions after the library had already listed miscellaneous items or contents, since by then it would have been too late.</p>

<p> The one listing that remained unaffected by the above methods was "You can see a note and a blue ball here. " One way we could change this is by incorporating a list of miscellaneous items into the room description itself, for example:</p>

 <p><div class="code"><pre>
study: Room 'Study' 'study'   
    "This is your favourite room in the whole house, where you do your best
    work, think your best thoughts, and read your best books. The way out is to
    the north. &lt;&lt;if listableContents.length &gt; 0&gt;&gt;\bIt's a bit messy right now
    since someone's left &lt;&lt;list of listableContents&gt;&gt; lying on the
    floor.&lt;&lt;end&gt;&gt;"
    
    north = hall
    out asExit(north)
    
    west = "Unfortunately you can't get the window open. "
    
    regions = downstairs
;
</pre></div>

<p>This works after a fashion, but it's less than ideal, not least because you may not want this list of miscellaneous items to appear before the specialDescs of other objects. We could get round that by attaching the list of the room's listableContents to the end of the desk's specialDesc, perhaps, but this would be a bit ad hoc and messy. A better way to customize the listing of miscellaneous items is probably by using a CustomRoomLister, which we'll look at next.</p>
<br>

<h2><a name="customroomlister">CustomRoomLister</a></h2>

<p>A CustomRoomLister allows us to customise the text that comes immediately before and after the list of miscellaneous items in a room listing. To use a CustomRoomLister you attach it to the roomContentsLister property of the room in question and pass the prefix and suffix text you want to use via its constructor, thus:</p>

 <p><div class="code"><pre>
study: Room 'Study' 'study'   
    "This is your favourite room in the whole house, where you do your best
    work, think your best thoughts, and read your best books. The way out is to
    the north."
    
    north = hall
    out asExit(north)
    
    west = "Unfortunately you can't get the window open. "
    
    regions = downstairs
    
    roomContentsLister = new CustomRoomLister('Someone\'s left ', suffix: '
        lying on the floor. ')
;
</pre></div>

<p>Note that here the first parameter we pass to the CustomRoomLister's constructor is always the prefix string (since this is the most common case). Any other parameters we want to pass to this constructor are <em>optional named</em> paramaters, hence the need to include <span class="code">suffix:</span> before the suffix string we want to use. If we didn't pass a suffix string the lister would simply use a full stop at the end of the list.</p>

<p>The other named parameters we could supply are <strong>prefixMethod:</strong> and <strong>suffixMethod:</strong>. These enable us to define the methods the CustomRoomLister uses to display the prefix string and/or suffix string and are for use when simply supplying the strings themselves isn't flexible enough (typically because we need a verb to agree in number with the list of items we're displaying). Note that if we define prefixMethod, any string we supply for the prefix won't be used; likewise, if define suffixMethod, there's no point supplying a suffix string, since it won't be used (unless we define the suffix method as using it).</p>

<p>What the prefixMethod and suffixMethod parameters do is allow us to replace the CustomRoomLister's standard showListPrefix and showListSuffix methods with methods of our own devising. These methods take three parameters: showListPrefix(lst, pl, irName) and showListSuffix(lst, pl, irName). The <em>lst</em> parameter is the list of items to be listed. The <em>pl</em> parameter defines whether the list constitutes a plural (true) or singular(nil) grammatical subject (it's plural either if there's more than one item in the list or if the first item in the list is itself plural). The <em>irName</em> parameter is the 'inRoomName' of the room whose contents we're listing, and is only really relevant if we're listing the contents of a <a href="senseregion.htm#descriptions">remote location</a>.</p>

<p>To define a prefix or suffix method on a CustomRoomLister we therefore need to name the parameter, use the <strong>method</strong> keyword to define a method with three parameters, and then write our method definition within curly braces, for example:</p>

 <p><div class="code"><pre>
study: Room 'Study' 'study'   
    "This is your favourite room in the whole house, where you do your best
    work, think your best thoughts, and read your best books. The way out is to
    the north."
    
    north = hall
    out asExit(north)
    
    west = "Unfortunately you can't get the window open. "
    
    regions = downstairs
    
    roomContentsLister = new CustomRoomLister(nil, prefixMethod: 
                                              method (lst, pl, irName) 
        {"Lying on the floor &lt;&lt;if pl&gt;&gt;are&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;is&lt;&lt;end&gt;&gt; ";})
;
</pre></div>

<p>Note that since we don't need a prefix string here, we supply the first parameter as nil. We'd define a suffix method in much the same way, for example:</p>

 <p><div class="code"><pre>
study: Room 'Study' 'study'   
    "This is your favourite room in the whole house, where you do your best
    work, think your best thoughts, and read your best books. The way out is to
    the north."
    
    north = hall
    out asExit(north)
    
    west = "Unfortunately you can't get the window open. "
    
    regions = downstairs
    
    roomContentsLister = new CustomRoomLister('\^', suffixMethod: 
                                              method (lst, pl, irName) 
        {" &lt;&lt;if pl&gt;&gt;are&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;is&lt;&lt;end&gt;&gt; lying on the floor. ";})
;
</pre></div>

<p>Note that in this case we supply '\^' as the prefix string to make sure that the sentence listing the room contents starts with a capital letter.</p>
<br>

<a name='simpler'>
<h2>Simpler Customization of Miscellaneous Item Listing</h2>
<p>There is one customization we can make without needing to use a <code>CustomRoomLister</code>, namely what appears at the end of a list of miscellaneous items in a room description (the miscellaneous items being portable items that are directly in the room and so notionally lying on the ground). By default this is just 'here', but we can change that by overriding the Room's <b>miscListSuffix</b> property, either on individual rooms or on the Room class. For example, if we wanted all such items to be explicitly listed as lying on the ground in every Room we could make the override:</p>

<p><div class="code"><pre>
modify Room
    miscListSuffix = 'lying on the ground'
;
</pre></div>

<p>And then we'd see listings like "You see A,B and C lying on the ground" instead of "You see A, B and C here."</p>

<p>We can also do this with nested rooms (Booths and Platforms). Suppose one of the rooms in our game is a garden that contains a transparent greenhouse we've implement as a Booth. If the player character drops an item, a floppy hat, say, in the garden and then enters the greenhouse and looks around from there, the room description will include the miscellaneous item listing:</p

<p><div class="cmdline"><pre>
   You see a floppy hat here.
</pre></div>

<p>But this is potentially misleading, since it suggests that the floppy hat is in the greenhouse, when it is in fact outside the greenhouse and in the enclosing garden. It would be better if it were listed as:</p>

<p><div class="cmdline"><pre>
   You see a floppy hat out in the garden.
</pre></div>

<p>We can achieve that by defining the greenhouse's <code>miscListSuffix</code> property as 'out in the garden', which means that when we look around from within the greenhouse anything outside the greenhouse and directly in the garden will be listed appropriately as being "out in the garden." Just to emphasize the point, we use <code>miscListSuffix</code> on an object not to customize how items listed <i>inside</i> the object (in this example, the greenhouse) are listed, but to customize how items located directly in the enclosing Room are listed from the perspective of someone inside the object (here, the greenhouse).</p>

<p>Now suppose that in addition to the greenhouse we had a garden shed and a coal bunker also defined as Booths in the garden, and we wanted any miscellaneous items directly in the garden to be listed as being "out in the garden" from the perspective of all three Booths. We could repeat the definition of <code>miscListSuffix</code> on all three Booths, but an alternative would be to use the <b>getMiscListSuffix(pov)</b> method of the enclosing room.</p>

<p><div class="code"><pre>
garden Room 'Garden'
   "Amongst other things in this garden you see a greenouse, a small garden shed, and a coal bunker. "
 
    getMiscListSuffix(pov)
    {
        if(pov.isIn(greenhouse) || pov.isIn(shed) || pov.isIn(coalBunker))
            return 'out in the garden';		
        return 'lying on the ground';
    }    
;
</pre></div>

<p>The <code>getMiscListSuffix(pov)</code> method is defined on the Thing class, so we <i>could</i> use it on any Booths and Platforms in our Room, but it is probably best used (if at all) on the outermost Room. You <i>can</i> mix and match both approaches, but you then need to take care that they don't interfere with each other. What <code>getMiscListSuffix(pov)</code> does is to call <code>getMiscListSuffix(pov)</code> on its location  until it either reaches the outermost Room or an object with a non-nil <code>miscListSuffix</code> property , in which case it uses that <code>miscListSuffix</code> property.</p>
<br>

<h2><a name="further">Further Listing Options</a></h2>

<p>Consider the original version of the study room definition which resulted in a listing like:</p>

<p><div class="cmdline"><pre>
<strong>Study</strong>
This is your favourite room in the whole house, where you do your best work, think your best thoughts, 
and read your best books. The way out is to the north.

A fine old desk stands in the middle of the room. 

On the desk you see a blue book and a red box.

In the drawer you see a brown file.

In the red box you see a battery.
</pre></div>

<p>There are two further options you can set to change the way this basic listing is presented. The first is to change <strong>gameMain.paraBrksBtwnSubcontents</strong> to <span class="code">nil</span>, which will remove the paragraph breaks between the sentences that list the contents of the items in the room. In the above example, this would mean that the final three sentences would be run together into a single paragraph, thus:</p>

<p><div class="cmdline"><pre>
<strong>Study</strong>
This is your favourite room in the whole house, where you do your best work, think your best thoughts, 
and read your best books. The way out is to the north.

A fine old desk stands in the middle of the room. 

On the desk you see a blue book and a red box. In the drawer you see a brown file. In the red box you see a battery.
</pre></div>
<a name="parabrk"></a>
<p>Note that the <strong>paraBrksBtwnSubcontents</strong> property can also be overridden on individual rooms, if you wish; the default behaviour is for every room to take the value of this property from the setting on gameMain.</p>

<p>A second option is to set <strong>gameMain.useParentheticalListing</strong> to true. This would result in output like:</p>

<p><div class="cmdline"><pre>
<strong>Study</strong>
This is your favourite room in the whole house, where you do your best work, think your best thoughts, 
and read your best books. The way out is to the north.

A fine old desk stands in the middle of the room. 

On the desk you see a blue book and a red box (in which is a battery).

In the drawer you see a brown file.
</pre></div>

<p>You can control the nesting depth of parenthetical listing by overriding the value of <strong>subLister.maxNestingDepth</strong>. The default value is 1, resulting in output like:</p>

<p><div class="cmdline"><pre>
<strong>Study</strong>
This is your favourite room in the whole house, where you do your best work, think your best thoughts, 
and read your best books. The way out is to the north.

A fine old desk stands in the middle of the room. 

On the desk you see a blue book and a glass case (in which is a red box).

In the drawer you see a brown file.
</pre></div>

<p>If you increased the <span class="code">maxNestingDepth</span> to 4, say, you might potentially see something like:</p>

<p><div class="cmdline"><pre>
<strong>Study</strong>
This is your favourite room in the whole house, where you do your best work, think your best thoughts, 
and read your best books. The way out is to the north.

A fine old desk stands in the middle of the room. 

On the desk you see a blue book and a glass case (in which is a red box (in which is a saucer (on which is a matchbox (in which is a tiny battery)))).

In the drawer you see a brown file.
</pre></div>

<p>If you set both <span class="code">paraBrksBtwnSubcontents</span> and <span class="code">useParentheticalListing</span> to true, your output might look like: </p>

<p><div class="cmdline"><pre>

<br>
<h2><a name="whatlisted">Determining What's Listed</a></h2>

<p>Various (true or nil) properties are available to customize which items are actually included in the listing of an item's contents, whether in a room listing, or in response to an EXAMINE, INVENTORY or SEARCH command.</p>

<p>The properties in question are the Thing <strong>lookListed</strong>, <strong>examineListed</strong>, <strong>searchListed</strong>, <strong>contentsListedInLook</strong>, <strong>contentsListedInExamine</strong> and <strong>contentsListedInSearch</strong>. The first three of these determine whether an item is listed as part of the miscellaneous contents of its parent in response to a LOOK command, or when its parent is EXAMINED, or when its parent is searched (with SEARCH or LOOK IN/UNDER/BEHIND) respectively. The second three determine whether the contents of the item on which it is defined are listed in response to a LOOK, EXAMINE or SEARCH command. By default <span class="code">examineListed</span>, <span class="code">lookListed</span> and <span class="code">searchListed</span> all take their value from the <span class="code">isListed</span> property. The <span class="code">contentsListedInLook</span> and <span class="code">contentsListedInExamine</span> properties both take their default values from the <span class="code">contentsListed</span> property (which is true by default). The default value of <span class="code">contentsListedInSearch</span>, however, is simply <span class="code">true</span>, since it's hard to think of many cases where you wouldn't want an object to reveal its contents when explicitly searched; the property is nevertheless provided for completeness.</p></p>

<p>The <span class="code">inventoryListed</span> property determines whether an object is listed in response to an INVENTORY command. It too takes its default value from <span class="code">isListed</span>.</p>
<br>

<a name='dirlook'></a>
<h2>Directional Looking</h2>
<p>By directional looking we mean looking in a specified direction with commands like LOOK NORTH, LOOK DOWN or LOOK STARBOARD. In the main library one of three things will happen in response to such commands:</p>
<ol>
<li>If there's an object in scope whose vocab matches the direction name speficied, such as a 'north wall' or a sky object with 'up' in its vocab, that object will be described (just as if the player had typed X NORTH or X UP).</i>
<li>Otherwise, if the player typed LOOK IN they'll be asked what they want to look in.</li>
<li>Otherwise a message will be displayed saying there's no need to look in any direction in this game.</li>
</ol>
<p>The idea is to avoid responses of the kind "You see no north here" (which might otherwise result without this framework) while relieving game authors of the need to provide customized responses to LOOK NORTH and the like by gently discouraging players from attempting such commands. It also allows game authors to implement customized responses by adding the appropriate direction names to the vocab of various objects, such as 'up' to a sky object, 'down' and 'd' to a floor object or 'north' and 'n' to a fence running along a northern boundary.</p>

<p>This may be absolutely fine for your game, but you may want to consider whether patchy implentation of responses to directional looking commands by such means risks looking inconsistent while consistent implementation along such lines might risk creating a good deal of unnecessary work. Games that want to provide more abundant use of directional looking commands may accordingly benefit from using the <a href='../../extensions/docs/lookdir.htm'>LookDir</a> extension, which can be used to customize the response to LOOK &lt;DIR&gt; without the need to create lots of objects with vocab containing direction names. It instead sllows game authors to define such responses on the <code>xxxLook</code> properties of the relevant location, e.g., <code>eastLook = 'You see a large house standing to the east'</code>). The extension can also partly automate the task by constructing responses based on what's attached to the corresponding direction properties in the current location (for example, if the <code>east</code> property points to a red door, LOOK EAST will tell a player that a red door lies that way).</p>
