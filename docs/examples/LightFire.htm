<h1>Exercise 17 - Light Sources (adv3)</h1>

<p>This game is a demonstration of the standard library light and fire classes. </p>

<p>The game presented here follows the specifications of Exercises 17 in <i>Learning TADS 3</i>. The specification is:</p>

<p>Write a short game in which the player character has to explore a small network of dark caves to find a magic glowing crystal. Implement the full variety of different kinds of light sources for exploring the caves. The player character starts only with a book of matches, each of which only stays lit for a couple of turns before burning out. Thereâ€™s a candle in the first cave (but only with a limited life). Another cave contains an oil lamp, but it's low on oil. Yet another cave contains an oil can you can refill it from, and another cave contains a flashlight. The final cave contains a rusty old box containing the crystal.</p>
