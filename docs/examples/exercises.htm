<h1>Examples</h1>
<p>Included here are a set of ten sample games which illustrate the use of various parts of the TADS 3 Libraries. For each game there is a version for adv3 and adv3Lite, so this collection can be used either to compare how things are done in the two different libraries or how to perform common tasks in one of them. These games also form a set of solutions to some of the exercises suggested in <i>Learning TADS 3</i> and <i>Learning TADS 3 With Adv3Lite</i>. They may be used in conjunction with those books or simply as a set of standalone examples.</p>
