<h1>Exercise 18 - Nested Rooms (adv3)</h1>

<p>This game is a demonstration of adv3 Nested Rooms.</p>

<p>The game presented here follows the specifications of Exercises 18 in <i>Learning TADS 3</i>. The specification is:</p>

<p>Create a one-room game consisting of the Player Character's bedsit. This will contain a bed (of course) under which is a drawer containing a pillow. There’s also a desk, a swivel chair (too unstable to stand on) and an armchair (too heavy to move), as well as a large sofa that’s large enough to lie on. Above the desk is a high bookshelf on which is a solitary book. To reach the shelf or the book the player character must stand on the desk. On another wall is a high bunk bed which can only be reached via a ladder that’s currently stored under the desk. Beneath the bunk bed is a wooden bench seat, attached to the wall; there’s insufficient headroom under the bunk bed to stand on the bench, and insufficient headroom above it to stand on the bunk. Also on the floor under the bunk is a sleeping cat. Finally, there’s an openable wardrobe that’s large enough to walk into; inside the wardrobe is a hanging rail on which is a solitary coat-hanger. If you’re feeling really adventurous make it so that in general an actor inside a Nested Room can’t reach outside it (there will need to be exceptions to this), and will automatically be taken out of the Nested Room if s/he tries.</p>

 *   A demonstration of the TADS 3 NestedRoom classes.
 *
 *   This is only minimally a game; there's nothing for the player to do but 
 *   try out the various kinds of NestedRoom. The 'game' is also fairly 
 *   minimal in that very little has been implemented apart from what's

    &amp;quot;One thing that can be said for this room is that it is at least reasonably
    large. Whoever furnished it seems to have been in two minds about sleeping
    arrangements, since in addition to the conventional bed over in one corner,
    there's a bunk high up on one wall, over a short wooden bench. Fortunately
    the bench is not the only thing to sit on, since there's also a comfortable
    armchair and a long sofa. There's also a large desk, situated under a
    bookshelf that's fixed inconveniently high up the wall, and a built-in
