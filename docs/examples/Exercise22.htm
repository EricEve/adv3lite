<h1>Exercise 22 - Attachments (adv3Lite)</h1>

<p>Attachments is a demonstration of adv3Lite Attachable classes.</p>



<p>The game follows the specification of Exercise 22 in <i>Learning TADS 3 with Adv3Lite</i>:

<p>The player character is the only survivor aboard a small scouting space-ship that has just been attacked, holing its hull so that all the air is evacuated, killing everyone else aboard. The player character has survived since he was suited up making repairs to the antenna on the outside of the ship when the attack occurred. The attacking vessel has departed, but now the player character must effect repairs to take his own ship to safety.
The player character starts the game in the airlock. He is wearing a space suit to which is attached an air cylinder (nearly exhausted) and a helmet; a lamp is currently plugged into the helmet but can be unplugged from it and plugged in elsewhere for recharging. Just as the game begins, the lights aboard ship go out, indicating a power failure. The outer and inner airlock doors are operated by levers, with dials indicating the air pressure outside the hull, inside the airlock, and inside the ship.</p>

<p>Just inboard of the airlock is a storage chamber with a rack containing a spare air cylinder (full enough to last the whole game and more), a charging socket, an equipment locker, a freezer, and a winch (fixed in place). Inside the equipment locker are two connectors (for joining lengths of cable), a short length of cable, and a roll of hull repair fabric. To operate the winch while the main power supply is out, it is necessary to attach one end of the cable to the winch and the other to the charging socket. The charging socket can also be used to recharge the lamp, when the lamp is plugged into it. A hawser runs from the winch; one end of the hawser can be carried by the player character into other locations (in which case there’ll be a length of hawser running all the way back to the winch); if the free end of the hawser is attached to something (such as a pile of debris) and the winch then operated (by pressing a button on it while the winch has power), the hawser will be rewound, dragging whatever’s attached to the other end with it.
Aft of the storage hold is the Engine Room. Here there’s a power switch that can be turned on to restore power to the whole ship, but only once the main fault has been repaired, and an airflow control lever than can be pulled to repressurize the ship, but only once the hole in the hull has been repaired.</p>
<p>
Forward of the Storage Hold is the Living Quarters, which took the brunt of the blast from the attacking vessel, and now has a large hole in part of the hull. This can be repaired by attaching a square of fabric from the locker to the hull. To one side of the Living Quarters is the door into a cabin, but this won’t open until pressure has been restored to the ship. Along the floor of the Living Quarters is an electrical conduit which contains the main power cable for the ship (now exposed by the same blast that tore through the hull). A length of the cable has been burned away, and must be repaired by attaching the short length of cable from the locker to the two ends of the severed cable by means of the electrical connectors (also from the locker). Unfortunately, the mass of debris left over from the blast blocks access to the conduit to repair the cable, and can only be removed by using the winch and hawser.
Once the hull has been patched the ship can be repressurized (using the lever in the Engine Room), and once the ship has been repressurized the cabin door can be opened, allowing access to the cabin. Inside the cabin is a bed and a cabinet, the latter containing a security card.</p>
<p>
Forward of the Living Quarters is the Bridge, containing (amongst anything else you think should be on the Bridge of a scouting space-ship) a card reader and green button. If the green button is pressed once main power has been restored and the security card is attached to the card reader, the controls come back to life, and the game is won.</p>

 *   EXERCISE 22 - ATTACHMENT
 *
 *   A demonstration of adv3Lite Attachable classes.
 *
 *   Handling Attachables is not always straightforward, to say the least, so
 *   this is the most complex of the demo games. If you have not already done
 *   so, you may want to become familiar with the other demo games first.
 *
 *   Attachables are complicated because there is so many different ways in
 *   which they could behave that the library classes can only provide a general
 *   framework which the game author must customize to suit each particular
 *   case. For example, if I attach a rope to a heavy box lying on the floor and
 *   then try to walk out of the room still holding the rope, a number of
 *   different things might happen, including:
 *
 *   (1)    I walk into the next room, still holding the rope, dragging the box
 *   along behind me.
 *
 *   (2)    I walk into the next room, still holding the rope, but it becomes
 *   detached from the box.
 *
 *   (3)    I walk into the next room, still holding the rope, which is so long
 *   that it has not yet become taut.
 *
 *   (4)    I am jerked to a halt by the rope, which has become taut, and cannot
 *   leave the room while I am holding the rope.
 *
 *   (5)    I walk into the room, but am forced to let go of the rope in the
 *   process.
 *
 *   And those are just the possibilities involving a rope attached to a box;
 *   many other kind of attachment relationships are possible.
 *
 *   Given the vast number of possibilities, this demonstration game cannot hope
 *   to cover them all, and will only attempt a small range by way of
 *   illustration.
 *
 *   Also, because this game is already quite complex enough, and is intended
 *   primarily to illustrate the use of Attachables, this comments in the source
 *   code will be largely restricted to those parts of the code relating to the
 *   implementation of Attachable objects.
 *
 *   Finally, in adv3Lite the Attachable classes all descend from
 *   SimpleAttachable which implements simpler cases of attachment.

        &quot;This is primarily a demonstration of adv3Lite Attachables. The game can
        be played through to a winning conclusion (or a losing one!), but it has
        been designed with demonstrating Attachables in mind rather than
        creating something that is a particularly great game.\b
        If you do want to play through the game and find you get stuck, remember
        that this is demonstration of attachable objects. Most of the things you
        need to do in this game will involve attaching (or detaching) objects to
        one another.&lt;.p&gt;&quot;;

        &quot;You weren't keen on being the one ordered outside to go and fix the
        transmission aerial, but that space-walk probably saved your life.\b
        The Federation warship (at least, you assume it was a Federation
        warship) appeared as if from nowhere and struck without warning, holing
        the tiny spy-ship with a single blast of its laser canon, and throwing
        you from your precarious perch. You very much doubt anyone inside the
        ship could have survived -- no one else was suited up and the
        decompression would have killed them almost instantly.\b
        Fortunately the hostile warship vanished as suddenly as it appeared,
        assuming its work was done and not even bothering to check for
        survivors. There very nearly weren't any; it took you over an hour to
        work your way back to the ship and in through the airlock, by which
        time the oxygen in your tank was all but exhausted. Removing your
        helmet you gasped gratefully at the air in the airlock, remembering to
        switch off your helmet lamp as it, too, was starting to dim.\b
        But it seems your troubles are far from over yet.\b&quot;;
