<h1>Exercise 23 - An Eventful Walk (adv3)</h1>

<p>This game is a demonstration of the various EventList classes in TADS.</p>
 
 <p>It also demonstrates Menus, Hints and Scoring (which, after all,
have to be demonstrated in conjunction with something. 
    There are several methods of scoring in TADS 3. Here we'll demonstrate only
    the that which uses Achievement objects to keep track of the score, calling
    their awardPointsOnce method. This allows the game to calculate the maximum
    score automatically for us.</p>

<p>The game follows the specification of Exercise 23 in <i>Learning TADS</i>:

<p>TThe map for this game is fairly simple. Play starts in 'Deep in the Forest' from which paths lead northeast, southeast and west. To the west is a dead end (blocked by a fallen tree), but attempting to travel down it the first time results in the player character finding a branch, which he takes. In the starting location itself a variety of forest sounds can be heard, or small animals seen moving about.  Northeast from the starting location is the 'By the River' location. From here paths run southwest, back to the starting location, and southeast. Progress north is blocked by the stream. If the player attempts to cross the stream, the first two attempts are blocked with suitable messages, but the third time the attempt is allowed, and the player character drowns. This happens whether the player types <strong>north</strong> or <strong>swim river</strong>, but the first two refusal responses should differ according to the command used. Thick undergrowth prevents walking along the bank of the stream to east and west. There should be a suitable selection of riverside atmospheric messages.</p>

<p>Southeast of 'By the River' is 'Outside a Cave', from which paths run northwest (back to the river) and southwest (to a clearing). The cave lies to the east. The cave is in darkness, and the only way out from it is to the west. The second time the player character leaves the cave there’s a warning message about an imminent rockfall. The third time the player leaves the cave the rockfall occurs, blocking the entrance to the cave. Inside the cave is a bucket, but the player character can’t find it until light is brought into the cave.</p>

<p>Southwest of 'Outside a Cave' is a clearing, from which paths run northeast (back to 'Outside a Cave') and northwest (back to the starting location, 'Deep in the Forest'). In the clearing a large bonfire is billowing clouds of acrid smoke, the smell of which is described as increasingly overwhelming the longer the player character remains in the clearing. The player character needs to leave the clearing to the south in order to find the way back to the car park and win the game, but the smoke keeps driving him back. There’s also a very simple NPC who starts out in this location, a tall man who walks round and round the four locations in the forest, but stops for one turn each time he reaches the river to scoop up some water in his hands.</b>

<p>To win the game the player needs to light the branch from the bonfire to make it act as a torch, then go to the cave to collect the bucket, fill the bucket with water from the river, then pour the water on the bonfire to douse it, and finally leave the clearing to the south.</p>

<p>Provide the game with a help/about menu, a set of adaptive hints, and a score for each step. Make the game automatically calculate the maximum score.</p>

 *   THING STATE
 *
 *   A ThingState is mainly used to determine what vocabulary can be used to 
 *   refer to an object and how it appears in certain listings. Here we are 
 *   also using it for a couple of other custom purposes of our own devising.
 *
 *   The bonfire defined above can be in one of two states; the fireLitState 
 *   when it's lit, and the fireOutState when it's been put out.
 *
 *   stateTokens is a library property, defining words that can be used to 
 *   refer to the bonfire only when its in the relevant state. Note that 
 *   this words must also appear in the bonfire's vocabWords property. The 
 *   effect is that 'blazing', 'hot' and 'flames' can all be used to refer 
 *   to the fire only when it's lit, and that 'smouldering' and 'warm' can 
 *   only be used to refer to it after it has gone out.
 *
 *   stateDesc and feelDesc are two custom properties we have defined to make
 *   defining the desc and feelDesc properties of the bonfire a little 
 *   neater; instead of having to use a conditional (if or switch) statement 
 *   to vary their descriptions according to the state of the bonfire, they 
 *   can just use getState.stateDesc or getState.feelDesc. This use of 
 *   ThingState is not documented anywhere else, but seems perfectly 
 *   legitimate and genuinely useful.
