<h1>Exercise 18 - Nested Rooms (adv3Lite)</h1>

<p>This game is a demonstration of adv3Lite Nested Rooms (non-Room Things that can contain actors and/or the player character).</p>

<p>The game presented here follows the specifications of Exercises 18 in <i>Learning TADS 3 with adv3Lite</i>. The specification is:</p>

<p>Create a one-room game consisting of the Player Character's bedsit. This will contain a bed (of course) under which is a drawer containing a pillow. There’s also a desk, a swivel chair (too unstable to stand on) and an armchair (too heavy to move), as well as a large sofa that’s large enough to lie on. Above the desk is a high bookshelf on which is a solitary book. To reach the shelf or the book the player character must stand on the desk. On another wall is a high bunk bed which can only be reached via a ladder that’s currently stored under the desk. Beneath the bunk bed is a wooden bench seat, attached to the wall; there’s insufficient headroom under the bunk bed to stand on the bench, and insufficient headroom above it to stand on the bunk. Also on the floor under the bunk is a sleeping cat. Finally, there’s an openable wardrobe that’s large enough to walk into; inside the wardrobe is a hanging rail on which is a solitary coat-hanger. If you’re feeling really adventurous make it so that in general an actor inside a Nested Room can’t reach outside it (there will need to be exceptions to this), and will automatically be taken out of the Nested Room if s/he tries.</p>

 *   A MODIFICATION TO PLATFORM
 *
 *   By default the library enforces no reachability conditions when the 
 *   actor is in an ordinary Platform, but this can seem a bit 
 *   unrealistic. For example the standard library behaviour would allow the 
 *   PC to open the wardrobe while lying on the bed, and this is surely 
 *   rather implausible.
 *
 *   The following modification to Platform changes that behaviour by 
 *   making an actor leave a Platform in order to perform an action that 
 *   requires touching an object that's not in the Platform.

 *
 *   Starting location - we'll use this as the player character's initial

 *   library, but note that it has to match up with the initial location for the
 *   player character, defined in the &quot;me&quot; object below.
 *
 *   Our definition defines three strings.  The first string, which must be in
 *   single quotes, is the &quot;name&quot; of the room; the name is displayed on the
 *   status line and each time the player enters the room.  The second (which is
 *   option) is in single quotes and defines the vocab property for the room.
 *   The third string, which must be in double quotes, is the &quot;description&quot; of
 *   the room, which is a full description of the room.  This is displayed when
 *   the player types &quot;look around,&quot; when the player first enters the room, and
 *   any time the player enters the room when playing in VERBOSE mode.
 *
 *   The name &quot;startRoom&quot; isn't special - you can change this any other name
 *   you'd prefer.  The player character's starting location is simply the
 *   location where the &quot;me&quot; actor is initially located.

    &quot;One thing that can be said for this room is that it is at least reasonably

    arrangements, since in addition to the conventional bed over in one corner,
    there's a bunk high up on one wall, over a short wooden bench. Fortunately
    the bench is not the only thing to sit on, since there's also a comfortable
    armchair and a long sofa. There's also a large desk, situated under a
    bookshelf that's fixed inconveniently high up the wall, and a built-in
