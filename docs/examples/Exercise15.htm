<h1>Exercise 15 - Fuses and Daemons (adv3Lite)</h1>

<p>This game is primarily intended as a demonstration of FUSES and DAEMONS, but this these classes can hardly be demonstrated in the abstract, so  we embed the demonstration in a brief game about Bomb Disposal. We also take the opportunity to demonstrate the INITOBJECT, PREINITOBJECT, 
COLLECTIVEGROUP and CONSULTABLE classes, all of which fit neatly in the game, but don't obviously fit in any other demo.</p>

<p>The game presented here combines the specifications of Exercises 15 and 16 in <i>Learning TADS 3 with adv3Lite</i>. The joint specification is:</p>

<p>The player character starts in a living room in wartime London, in which an unexploded bomb lies on the floor. He has 25 turns in which to defuse the bomb, after which it will explode. To defuse the bomb he has to remove a metal cap from it, which can only be removed with the aid of his spanner. This is one of his tools, which starts out in his black tool bag, which is out in the hall. The tool bag also contains his wire cutters and his bomb disposal manual.</p>

<p>Removing the cap from the bomb reveals five coloured wires in the detonator: red, blue, green, yellow, black. Cutting the right wire will defuse the bomb, but cutting the wrong one will make it go off. To find out which is the right wire, the player must determine which kind of bomb it is and then look it up in the bomb disposal manual. The serial number of the bomb is on the underside of the casing, so the player must look under the bomb to find it.</p>

<p>Out in the hall an inquisitive rat is scurrying around, so we should display a series of messages describing what it’s up to. We should also display a series of random messages describing sounds coming from outside the house. Finally, when there’s only five turns left, the bomb should start ticking louder, as a hint to the player that he needs to hurry up.</p>

<p>Complete the Bomb Disposal example by adding appropriate introductory text and suitable winning and losing endings. Also add start-up code to randomize which is the correct wire for the player to cut.</p>

    &quot;There's no entry for that. The Germans don't seem to be using purely

;

<span class="comment">/*   
 *   PREINIT OBJECT
 *
 *   The manual is described as being a thick one, so we might expect to find
 *   entries for bomb codes other than ZP640. This ConsultTopic will match 
 *   on any pattern consisting of 1-4 letters followed by 1-4 numbers, or 1-4
 *   numbers followed by 1-4 letters, so that the manual will seem to have 
 *   entries for a vast range of codes. It will then assign a random 
 *   description to the wire that would need to be cut for that kind of bomb.
 *
 *   One complication is that we don't want this ConsultTopic to match 
 *   ZP640, so we give it a lower matchScore than the ZP640 ConsultTopic (80 
 *   instead of the default 100, which is what the +80 in the template means).
 *
 *   The second complication is that if the player enters the same code 
 *   twice, s/he ought to see the same response. If we kept returning a 
 *   random description, then repeatedly looking up, say, PTR534 would tell 
 *   the player first to cut the green wire, then the pink wire, and then 
 *   the long wire (say) and this would look wrong. We therefore store the 
 *   random response this ConsultTopic gives in a LookupTable, so that if 
 *   the player subsequently looks up the same code, this ConsultTopic will 
 *   give the same response. 
 *
 *   That's where the PreinitObject comes in -- we use the execute() method 
 *   of PreinitObject to set up the LookupTable. A PreinitObject is much 
 *   like an InitObject except that its execute() method is run as the last 
 *   stage of compilation rather than at game setup. This means that the 
 *   results of the PreinitObject's execute() method are stored in the game 
 *   image file and don't have to be recomputed each time the game starts. 
 *   PreinitObjects can't be used to display anything or start up Fuses or 
 *   Daemons, but they can be used to perform calculations or, as here, set 
 *   up data structures.
