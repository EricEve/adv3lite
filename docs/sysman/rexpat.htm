<h1>RexPattern</h1>

<p>A RexPattern object stores the internal representation, known as
the "compiled" version, of a regular expression pattern.  The internal
details of the compiled representation aren't important, and the
program can't access the compiled data directly.

<p>Every time the program performs a search involving a regular
expression (using the <a href='tadsgen.htm#rexmatch'><span class="code">rexMatch()</span>,
<span class="code">rexSearch()</span>, or <span class="code">rexReplace()</span> functions</a>), the system must
work with the compiled form of the search pattern.  The simplest way
to call these functions is to pass them a string giving the search
pattern, but when the program does this, the system must compile the
string, which converts the string to the internal representation.
This compilation process is relatively time-consuming; typically,
compiling the pattern takes about half the time involved in performing
a regular expression search.

<p>The purpose of the RexPattern class is to let the program perform
this compilation work just once for a given pattern string, and then
re-use the same compiled representation every time the program
searches for the pattern.  If a given pattern is used repeatedly, this
can improve the program's efficiency by avoiding repeated compilation
of the same pattern string.

<h2><a name="rexlit">Regular expression literals</a></h2>

<p>You can define a static RexPattern object using the regular
expression literal syntax:

<p><div class="code"><pre>
local r = R'%w+';
</pre></div>

<p>That defines a static RexPattern object that matches any
series of one or more "word" characters.

<p>The regular expression literal syntax consists of a capital "R"
followed immediately (with no intervening spaces) by an open quote.
Single and double quotes are interchangeable for "R" strings - they
have exactly the same meaning, but of course the ending quote must
match the open quote.  You can also use the triple-quote syntax
with "R" strings:

<p><div class="code"><pre>
local r2 = R"""%w"%w""";
</pre></div>

<p>That creates a pattern that matches a word character followed by
a double quote followed by a word character.  (In this case the
triple quotes aren't really necessary, in that it might
have been easier to just use single quotes to delimit the string:
<span class="code">R'%w"%w'</span>.)

<p>The embedding expression syntax, <span class="code">&lt;&lt; &gt;&gt;</span>, isn't allowed in
regular expression literals.


<h2>RexPattern creation</h2>

<p>You can create a RexPattern object dynamically using the <span class="code">new</span>
operator, giving the pattern string as the argument:

<p><div class="code"><pre>
local pat = new RexPattern('a.*b');
</pre></div>

<p>This creates the pattern object and compiles the pattern string.
You can now use the object in the regular expression search and match
functions (<span class="code">rexMatch()</span>, etc.) in place of the pattern string.  The
functions will behave exactly as though you had used the original
pattern string, except that they will run a little faster, because
they won't need to compile the string.

<h2>RexPattern methods</h2>

<p>The class provides the standard Object intrinsic class methods,
plus the following:

<p><span class="code">getPatternString()</span>
<div class=fdef>

Returns the original string used to create the object (i.e., the
string passed as the argument in the "new" expression that created the
object).
