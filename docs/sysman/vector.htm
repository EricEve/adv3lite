<h1>Vector</h1>

<p>Vector is a subclass of <a href='collect.htm'>Collection</a> that
provides an ordered collection of elements, like <a
href='list.htm'>List</a>, but provides "reference semantics," which
means that you can modify the elements of a Vector directly.

<p>To use the Vector class, you should <span class="code">#include &lt;systype.h&gt;</span> or
<span class="code">#include &lt;vector.h&gt;</span> in your source files.

<h2>Which should I use: List or Vector?</h2>

<p>The List and Vector classes are very similar; both of these classes
allow you to manage collections of values as a group.  The differences
between the classes are a little subtle, but they're important.

<p>Lists offer two unique features.  First, List is an intrinsic T3 VM
datatype, which makes it the "universal" collection type; some
functions and methods require list values, and won't accept other
collection types.  Second, Lists use "value semantics," so you never
have to worry about the effects of changing a list value to which
other parts of your program might be retaining references.

<p>Vectors use "reference semantics," which are sometimes trickier to
work with than a List's value semantics, but offer advantages in some
situations.  Reference semantics also make Vectors more efficient when
you're performing an iterative process that involves repeated updates
to a collection's elements: if you use a List for such a process, each
update to an element would create a new list value, whereas changes to
a Vector's elements simply change the existing Vector object, rather
than creating a new Vector.

<p>In general, you can decide which type of collection to use based on
what you're going to do with it:

<ul class=doublespace>

<li>If you're storing a value that will be used by many parts of your
program, such as in an object property, and the value won't be changed
frequently, List is a good choice.  Because of a list's value
semantics, the different parts of the code that refer to the same list
won't have to coordinate their activities if they make local changes
to the list.

<li>If you'll be updating the elements of a collection frequently, you
should use a Vector.  Using a Vector rather than a List avoids the
overhead of creating a new copy of the collection every time you
update one of its members.

<li>If you're dynamically building a collection through an iterative
process that involves repeated changes to the collection (additions of
new elements, removal of elements, or updates to existing element
values), you should use a Vector.

</ul>


<h2>Creating a Vector</h2>

<p>To create a Vector, you use the <span class="code">new</span> operator.  The constructor
can be called with several different argument formats.

<p>The simplest way to call the constructor is with no arguments.
This creates an empty Vector (one with no elements, and a length() of
zero) and a default "initial allocation size" (we'll explain what that
means shortly).

<p><div class="code"><pre>
local x = new Vector();
</pre></div>

<p>You can also use a single integer argument to specify an initial
allocation size.  This still creates an empty vector - its length()
will be zero - but it allows you to control how much memory is
initially allocated for the Vector.

<p><div class="code"><pre>
// create an empty Vector with an initial allocation of 10 elements
x = new Vector(10);
</pre></div>

<p>Next, you can create a Vector and fill it in with a given number of
elements already present, populated with <span class="code">nil</span> values.  To do this,
pass two integer values.  The first is the initial allocation length,
as above, and the second is the number of slots to fill in with
<span class="code">nil</span> values.  It's exactly as though you called <span class="code">append(nil)</span>
that many times after creating the Vector.

<p><div class="code"><pre>
// create a Vector with 10 slots allocated, and with 5 slots initially
// filled in with nil - so x.length() is 5
x = new Vector(10, 5);
</pre></div>

<p>You can also create a Vector as a copy of a List or another Vector.
To do this, pass in the source object as the single argument.  This
creates a new Vector object and copies all of the elements from the
source object.  The new Vector will have the same length() as the
source object, and an initial allocation equal to the length of the
source object.

<p><div class="code"><pre>
// create a Vector with the same elements as a list
x = new Vector([1, 2, 3]);
</pre></div>

<p>Finally, you can create a copy of a List or Vector, and also specify
the initial allocation length.  This is useful if you want to leave
room in the initial allocation for adding more elements.

<p><div class="code"><pre>
// create a copy of the list, but allocate 10 elements initially
x = new Vector(10, [1, 2, 3]);
</pre></div>

<p>Note that if the initial allocation you specify in this kind of
call is smaller than what's required to copy the source object, the
constructor will obviously have to ignore that value and allocate
enough space to hold the initial values.

<h3>The initial allocation</h3>

<p>The constructor gives you the option to set the "initial
allocation" size for the Vector.  What is this?  Well, let's first
look at what it isn't.

<p>First, it's <i>not</i> the initial number of elements in the
Vector; that's determined by the other arguments.  For example,
<span class="code">new Vector(100)</span> creates an empty vector, even though you've specified a
fairly large initial allocation:

<p><div class="code"><pre>
x = new Vector(100);
say(x.length());  // displays "0"
</pre></div>

<p>Second, the initial allocation is <i>not</i> the maximum size that
the Vector can ever attain.  No matter what initial allocation size
you set, a Vector can grow to any length.  The system will simply keep
allocating more memory as needed when you add more elements.

<p><div class="code"><pre>
x = new Vector(1);
x.append(1);
x.append(2);
x.append(3);
say(x.length());  // displays "3"
</pre></div>

<p>Note that it's perfectly legal to add three elements to this
Vector, even though it was created with room for only one item.
A Vector always expands as needed.

<p>So if the initial allocation size doesn't set the initial number of
elements in the vector, and it doesn't set a maximum size, what good
is it?  And does it even matter what the value is?  The answer is that
setting affects the memory efficiency of the vector.  When you first
create the vector, the system internally allocates the number of slots
you specify in the initial allocation size; these slots are marked as
"not yet in use," because the vector contains no elements at this
point, but they're available for future use when you add elements.
When you add elements, the Vector puts them into these reserved slots,
which is a very fast operation.  If you add more elements than there
are reserved slots, the Vector must allocate more memory, which takes
a little more time.

<p>If you make the initial allocation size too small, the system will
have to allocate more memory for the Vector, possibly more than once,
as you add new elements.  If you make the initial allocation too
large, the vector will take up more memory than it will ever actually
need.

<p>Don't worry about this too much, though.  The Vector object manages
its memory automatically, so it's not a big deal if the initial size
is too high or too low.  The additional work of allocating more memory
isn't huge.  The initial size parameter is provided only so that you
can fine-tune your program's performance in cases where you have a
pretty good idea in advance of how large a vector will be; in cases
where you don't have any way of knowing, you can just pick a number
that seems in the ballpark for a typical case, or omit it entirely and
use the default size.

<h2>Vector operators</h2>

<p>The <span class="code">+</span> operator adds new elements to the end of a Vector.  If the
operand on the right side of the <span class="code">+</span> is a list or another Vector, its
elements are individually added to the vector; otherwise, the value on
the right side of the <span class="code">+</span> is added as a single new element.  Note that
this operator always creates a new Vector to store the result; the
original vector's value is unchanged.

<p>The <span class="code">-</span> operator removes elements from the Vector.  If the
operand on the right side of the <span class="code">-</span> is a list or Vector, each
element of the list of Vector is individually removed from the Vector
on the left of the <span class="code">-</span>.  If the operand on the right side of the
<span class="code">-</span> is not a list or vector, each element of the vector whose value
equals the right operand is deleted from the vector on the left.  Note
that the <span class="code">-</span> operator always creates a new Vector to store the
result.

<p>The indexing operator <span class="code">[ ]</span> can be used to get and set elements
of the array using an integer index, just as with a List.  If you
assign an element of the vector past the current length of the vector,
the vector is automatically extended to include the necessary number
of elements; new elements between the last existing element and the
element at the requested index are set to nil.  If you try to retrieve
a vector element with an index higher than any existing element, a
run-time exception ("index out of range") is thrown.

<p>A Vector can be used with the <span class="code">==</span> or <span class="code">!=</span> operators to compare a
Vector to another value.  A Vector is equal to another Vector or List
if the other Vector or List has the same number of elements, and each
element of the Vector equals the corresponding element of the other
Vector or List, using the same rules as the <span class="code">==</span> operator to compare
the elements.

<p>Note: Because the <span class="code">==</span> test is defined recursively, if a Vector
contains a reference to itself, either directly or indirectly through
another Vector, the <span class="code">==</span> test can recurse infinitely.  The Vector
class avoids this infinite recursion by limiting the depth of
recursion in an equality comparison to 256 levels.  If this recursion
depth is exceeded, the <span class="code">==</span> test throws an exception ("maximum
equality test/hash recursion depth exceeded").  This same exception
will result, for the same reason, if a Vector with a self-reference is
used as a key in a LookupTable.  The recursion depth exception can
occur even if a Vector contains no self-references, if it simply
contains such a complex series of references that it exceeds the
maximum depth.  Note that this limit does not have anything to do with
the number of elements in any Vector; rather, it pertains to the depth
of the references from one Vector to another.  So, if you create
Vectors A, B, C, D, ..., and set A[1] = B, B[1] = C, C[1] = D, and so on
for more than 256 vectors, then comparing A to another vector could
exceed the maximum depth.


<h3>String conversions</h3>

<p>A Vector value can be converted to a string using the
<a href="tadsgen.htm#toString">toString()</a> function.  A Vector can
also be used in a context where a non-string value is implicitly
converted to a string, such as in the
<a href="tadsio.htm#tadsSay">tadsSay()</a> function or in a string
concatenation (that is, on the right-hand side of a "+" operator where
the left-hand side is a string).

<p>The string conversion of a Vector consists of the Vector's
elements, each itself first converted to a string if necessary,
concatenated together, with commas separating elements.  For example,
<span class="code">toString(new Vector([1, 2, 3]))</span> yields the string <span class="code">'1,2,3'</span>.


<h2>Vector methods</h2>

<p>Vector is a subclass of <a href='collect.htm'>Collection</a>, so
the Collection methods are available on a Vector object.  In addition
to the Collection methods, Vector provides many methods of its own,
shown below.

<p><span class="code">append(<i>val</i>)</span>
<div class=fdef>

Appends the value <i>val</i> to the end of the vector, increasing the
vector's length by one.  This method has almost the same effect as the
<span class="code">+</span> operator, except for the treatment if <i>val</i> is a list: this
method simply appends a list value as a single new element, whereas
the <span class="code">+</span> operator appends each element of the list value as a separate
new element.  In addition, unlike the <span class="code">+</span> operator, this method
modifies the Vector object, rather than creating a new Vector to store
the result.  Returns <span class="code">self</span>.

</div>

<p><span class="code">appendAll(<i>val</i>)</span>
<div class=fdef>

This works like <span class="code">append(<i>val</i>)</span>, except that if <i>val</i> is a List
or Vector, each element of <i>val</i> is individually appended to the
target Vector.  This method works like the <span class="code">+</span> operator, except that
this method modifies the Vector, rather than creating a new
Vector to store the result.  Returns <span class="code">self</span>.

</div>

<p><span class="code">appendUnique(<i>val</i>)</span>
<div class=fdef>

Appends the elements of the list or Vector <i>val</i> to this vector;
the vector is modified so that it consists only of the unique elements
of the combination.  On return, any given value will appear in the
vector will appear only once.  Like <span class="code">append()</span> and <span class="code">appendAll()</span>, this
modifies the Vector directly.

</div>

<p><span class="code">applyAll(<i>func</i>)</span>
<div class=fdef>

For each element of the vector, this method invokes the callback
function <i>func</i>, passing the current element as the single
argument, then replaces the vector element with the return value from
the callback.  This method does not create a new Vector; rather, it
modifies the original Vector.  This method returns <span class="code">self</span> as the
result value.

<p>This method is useful for transforming the elements of a vector by
applying a modifier function.  For example, if we have a vector of
numbers, we could use this method to multiply each number in the
vector by two:

<p><div class="code"><pre>
x.applyAll({x: x*2});
</pre></div>

<p>This method is also handy for performing complex initializations on
a new Vector.  For example, here's a function that creates a new
vector and initializes it with the first <i>n</i> Fibonacci numbers.
Because we're simply initializing the new vector, note that the
callback function doesn't make any reference to the original element
value, but it must still declare a parameter for the argument value so
that the arguments passed from <span class="code">applyAll()</span> match the declaration.

<p><div class="code"><pre>
createFibonacciVector(n)
{
  local f0 = 0, f1 = 1;
  return new Vector(n, n).applyAll(function(x)
    { local ret = f0; f0 = f1; f1 += ret; return ret; });
}
</pre></div>

<p>Note that we specify the value <i>n</i> twice in the constructor to
explicitly set the initial size of the vector to <i>n</i> <span class="code">nil</span>
elements.  This is important because a newly-created vector normally
doesn't contain any elements, regardless of the initial allocation
setting; by explicitly using the initial length argument <i>n</i>, we
ensure that <span class="code">applyAll()</span> will visit <i>n</i> elements.

</div>

<p><span class="code">copyFrom(<i>source</i>, <i>sourceStart</i>, <i>destStart</i>, <i>count</i>)</span>
<div class=fdef>

Copies values from a list or from another list or vector into this
Vector.  This function doesn't create a new Vector, but simply
modifies entries in the <span class="code">self</span> vector.  <i>source</i> is the source
of the values; it must be either a vector or a list.
<i>sourceStart</i> is an index into source, and specifies the first
element of source that is to be copied.  <i>destStart</i> is an index
into the <span class="code">self</span> vector, and specifies the first element of the
vector that is to be modified.  <i>count</i> is the number of elements
to modify.  The method copies elements from <i>source</i> into the
<span class="code">self</span> vector, one at a time, until it reaches the last element of
source, or has copied the number of elements specified by count.

<p>If either starting index is negative, it counts backwards from the
last element of its vector: -1 is the last element, -2 is the second
to last, and so on.

<p>Calling this method is equivalent to writing a code fragment like this:

<p><div class="code"><pre>
for (local i = 0 ; i &lt; count ; ++i)
  dest[destStart + i] = source[sourceStart + i];
</pre></div>

<p>If necessary, the method expands the <span class="code">self</span> vector to make room for
the added elements.
 
<p>The <span class="code">copyFrom()</span> method simply returns <span class="code">self</span>; this is convenient for
expressions like this:

<p><div class="code"><pre>
x = new Vector(20).copyFrom(lst, 3, 2, 5);
</pre></div>

</div>

<p><span class="code">countOf(<i>val</i>)</span>
<div class=fdef>

Returns the number of elements in the vector whose values equal
<i>val</i>.

</div>

<p><span class="code">countWhich(<i>cond</i>)</span>
<div class=fdef>

Returns the number of elements in the vector for which the callback
function <i>cond</i> returns a non-false value (anything but <span class="code">nil</span>
or 0).  For each element in the Vector, the method invokes
<i>cond</i>, passing the element as the argument to the callback.  If
<i>cond</i> returns anything but <span class="code">nil</span> or 0, the method counts the
element.  After invoking <i>cond</i> for each element, the method
returns the number of elements for which <i>cond</i> returned a
non-false value.

</div>

<p><span class="code">fillValue(<i>value</i>, <i>start</i>?, <i>count</i>?)</span>
<div class=fdef>

Fills elements of this Vector with <i>value</i>.  If only <i>value</i>
is specified, this method simply stores <i>value</i> in every element
of the <span class="code">self</span> vector.  If <i>start</i> is specified, it gives the
starting index; the method fills values starting with <i>start</i>, to
the end of the Vector.  If both <i>start</i> and <i>count</i> are
specified, count gives the maximum number of elements to fill.

<p>If <i>start</i> isn't specified, the default starting index is 1.
If <i>start</i> is negative, it counts from the end of the vector:
-1 is the last element, -2 is the second to last, and so on.

<p>If <i>count</i> isn't specified, the default count is
<span class="code">self.length() -</span> <i>start</i> <span class="code">+ 1</span>, or 0 if that yields a
negative value.  In other words, the default <i>count</i> is chosen
to fill to the end of the existing elements of the Vector.
Note that this is the actual populated length of the Vector, <i>not</i>
the initial allocation size: <span class="code">new Vector(10).fillValue('x')</span> yields
a vector with zero elements filled in, not 10, because a Vector
created this way is initially empty - the <span class="code">10</span> is merely the initial
allocation size hint, not the initial filled length.

<p>This method is equivalent to writing a code fragment like this:

<p><div class="code"><pre>
for (local i = 0 ; i &lt; count ; ++i)
  dest[start + i] = value;
</pre></div>

<p>Calling <span class="code">fillValue()</span> is easier than writing this code fragment,
though, and considerably faster because it is implemented as native
code.

<p>This method returns <span class="code">self</span>, which allows for expressions like this:

<p><div class="code"><pre>
x = new Vector(20).fillValue('A', 1, 20);
</pre></div>

</div>

<p><span class="code">forEach(<i>func</i>)</span>
<div class=fdef>

Invokes the callback function <span class="code">(<i>func</i>)(<i>value</i>)</span> for each element, in
order from first to last, passing the value of one element as
<i>value</i> to the callback on each invocation.  The callback
function takes one argument giving the value of the current element,
and returns no value.  This method returns no value.  This method is a
convenient means of executing some code for each element of the
vector.

</div>

<p><span class="code">forEachAssoc(<i>func</i>)</span>
<div class=fdef>

Invokes the callback function <span class="code">(<i>func</i>)(<i>index</i>, <i>value</i>)</span> for each
element, in order from first to last, passing each element's index and
value to the function <i>func</i>.  The callback function returns no
value.  This method returns no value.  This method is the same as
<span class="code">forEach()</span>, except that this method provides the callback with the
index as well as the value for each element it visits.

</div>

<a name="generate"></a>
<p><span class="code">generate(<i>func</i>, <i>n</i>)</span>
<div class=fdef>

<p>Creates a new Vector containing <i>n</i> elements by invoking the
callback function <i>func</i> once for each element, and using the
return value as the element value.  This is a class method that you
call on the Vector class directly, as in <span class="code">Vector.generate(f, 10)</span>.

<p><i>func</i> is a callback function, which can be a regular function
or an anonymous function.  <i>func</i> can take zero or one argument.
The one-argument form is invoked with the index of the current element
as the argument on each call.

<p><span class="code">generate()</span> is convenient for creating a Vector of items based
on a formula.  For example, this creates a Vector of the first ten
positive even integers:

<p><div class="code"><pre>
local e = Vector.generate({i: i*2}, 10);
</pre></div>

</div>


<p><span class="code">getUnique()</span>
<div class=fdef>

Returns a new vector consisting of the unique elements of the original
vector.  For each value in the original vector, the value will appear
in the new vector only once.  The order of the elements in the new
vector is that of the first appearances of the unique elements of the
original vector.  For example, if the original vector's elements are,
in order, 1, 5, 2, 5, 3, 5, 4, 5, this method will return a new vector
whose elements are, in order, 1, 5, 2, 3, 4.  Note that the size of
the new vector is just large enough to hold only the unique elements,
so the new vector might be smaller than the original vector.

</div>

<p><span class="code">indexOf(<i>val</i>)</span>
<div class=fdef>

Finds the first element of the vector whose value equals <i>val</i>,
and returns the index of the element.  Returns <span class="code">nil</span> if none of the
vector's elements equals <i>val</i>.

</div>

<p><span class="code">indexOfMax(<i>func</i>?)</span>
<div class=fdef>

If <i>func</i> is omitted, returns the index of the element with the
maximum value, comparing values to one another as though using the
<span class="code">&gt;</span> operator.

<p>If <i>func</i> is specified, it must be a function
pointer.  The method calls <i>func</i>() for each element in the
vector, passing the element's value as the function argument.  The
function must return a value.  The result of <span class="code">indexOfMax</span> in this
case is the index of the element for which <i>func</i>() returned
the maximum value.

<p>For example, if <span class="code">v</span> is a vector containing string values
as elements,
<span class="code">v.indexOfMax({x: x.length()})</span> returns the index of the
longest string.

</div>

<p><span class="code">indexOfMin(<i>func</i>?)</span>
<div class=fdef>

If <i>func</i> is omitted, returns the index of the element with the
minimum value, comparing values to one another as though using the
<span class="code">&lt;</span> operator.

<p>If <i>func</i> is specified, it must be a function
pointer.  The method calls <i>func</i>() for each element in the
vector, passing the element's value as the function argument.  The
function must return a value.  The result of <span class="code">indexOfMin</span> in this
case is the index of the element for which <i>func</i>() returned
the minimum value.

<p>For example, if <span class="code">lst</span> is a vector containing string values
as elements,
<span class="code">v.indexOfMin({x: x.length()})</span> returns the index of the
shortest string.

</div>

<p><span class="code">indexWhich(<i>cond</i>)</span>
<div class=fdef>

Finds the first element for which the given condition is true.  The
method iterates through the elements of the vector, starting at the
first element and proceeding in order, and applies the callback
function <i>cond</i> to each element.  The callback takes one
argument, which is the value of the vector element, and returns a
condition result value.  For each element, if the callback function
returns a non-false value (i.e., any value except <span class="code">nil</span> or zero), the
method immediately stops the iteration and returns the index of that
element.  If the callback returns a false value (<span class="code">nil</span> or zero) for
every element of the vector, the method returns <span class="code">nil</span>.

</div>

<p><span class="code">insertAt(<i>startingIndex</i>, <i>val</i>, ...)</span>
<div class=fdef>

Inserts one or more values into the vector at the giving starting
index.  The size of the vector is increased to accommodate the new
elements.  Note that, if any of the values are lists or other
collections, they are simply inserted as single elements; this
contrasts with the <span class="code">+</span> operator, which adds each element of a list as
a separate element of the vector.

<p>If <i>startingIndex</i> is negative, it counts from the end of the
vector: -1 is the last element, -2 is the second to last, etc.  The
special value 0 means to insert after the last element.  If
<i>startingIndex</i> is positive, it must be in the range from 1 to
one higher than the length of the vector.  If the starting index value
is 1, the new elements are inserted before the first existing element
of the vector.  If the starting index is one higher than the length of
the vector, the new elements are appended after the last existing
element of the vector.  If the starting index is out of this valid
range, the method throws an error ("index out of range").

<p>Returns the <span class="code">self</span> object.

</div>

<a name="join"></a>
<p><span class="code">join(<i>sep</i>?)</span>
<div class=fdef>

Returns a string made by concatenating the elements of the vector
together in index order.  If <i>sep</i> is provided, it's a string
that's interposed between elements as a separator.  If <i>sep</i> is
omitted, the elements are concatenated with no separation.

<p>Each element is converted to a string using the usual
automatic conversions before it's concatenated.  If an element
can't be converted to string, the method throws an error.

</div>


<p><span class="code">lastIndexOf(<i>val</i>)</span>
<div class=fdef>

Returns the index of the last element in the vector whose value equals
<i>val</i>.  If none of the elements in the vector matches the given
value, the method returns <span class="code">nil</span>.

</div>

<p><span class="code">lastIndexWhich(<i>cond</i>)</span>
<div class=fdef>

Finds the last element for which the given condition is true.  This
method is similar to <span class="code">indexWhich(<i>cond</i>)</span>, but scans the vector in reverse
order, starting with the last element and working backwards.  Returns
the index of the matching element, or <span class="code">nil</span> if the condition returns
false for every element.

</div>

<p><span class="code">lastValWhich(<i>cond</i>)</span>
<div class=fdef>

Finds the last element for which the given condition is true, and
returns the element's value.  This method is similar to
<span class="code">lastIndexWhich(<i>cond</i>)</span>, but returns the value of the matching element
rather than its index.  Returns <span class="code">nil</span> if no matching element is found.

</div>

<p><span class="code">length()</span>
<div class=fdef>

Returns an integer giving the number of elements in the vector.  This
is the number of elements actually stored in the vector, and is
unrelated to the initial allocation size specified when the vector was
created.

</div>

<p><span class="code">mapAll(<i>func</i>)</span>
<div class=fdef>

Creates a new vector consisting of the results of applying the
callback function <i>func</i> to each element of the original vector.
This method is similar to <span class="code">applyAll(<i>func</i>)</span>, but rather than modifying
the elements of the original vector, this method creates a new vector,
and leaves the elements of the original vector unchanged.  The return
value is the new vector.

</div>

<p><span class="code">maxVal(<i>func</i>?)</span>
<div class=fdef>

If <i>func</i> is omitted, returns the maximum of the element values
in the vector, comparing values to one another as though using the <span class="code">&gt;</span>
operator.

<p>If <i>func</i> is specified, it must be a function
pointer.  The method calls <i>func</i>() for each element in the
vector, passing the element's value as the function argument.  The
function must return a value.  The result of <span class="code">maxVal</span> in this
case is the value of the element that maximizes <i>func</i>.
Note that the <b>element value</b> is returned, <i>not</i> the return
value of <i>func</i>.

<p>For example, if <span class="code">v</span> is a vector containing string values,
<span class="code">v.maxVal({x: x.length()})</span> returns the 
longest string element.

</div>

<p><span class="code">minVal(<i>func</i>?)</span>
<div class=fdef>

If <i>func</i> is omitted, returns minimum of the element values
in the vector, comparing values to one another as though using the
<span class="code">&lt;</span> operator.

<p>If <i>func</i> is specified, it must be a function
pointer.  The method calls <i>func</i>() for each element in the
vector, passing the element's value as the function argument.  The
function must return a value.  The result of <span class="code">minVal</span> in this
case is the element value that minimizes <i>func</i>
Note that the <b>element value</b> is returned, <i>not</i> the return
value of <i>func</i>.

<p>For example, if <span class="code">v</span> is a vector containing string values,
<span class="code">v.minVal({x: x.length()})</span> returns the shortest
string element.

</div>

<p><span class="code">prepend(<i>val</i>)</span>
<div class=fdef>

Inserts the value <i>val</i> before the first element of the vector,
increasing the vector's length by one.  This method is similar to
<span class="code">append(<i>val</i>)</span>, but inserts the new element at the start of the vector
rather than at the end.  Returns <span class="code">self</span>.

</div>

<p><span class="code">removeElement(<i>val</i>)</span>
<div class=fdef>

Deletes one or more elements from the vector; each vector element
whose value equals <i>val</i> is removed from the vector.  This
reduces the length of the vector by the number of elements removed.
If there is no element of the vector whose value equals <i>val</i>,
the vector is unchanged.  Returns <span class="code">self</span>.

</div>

<p><span class="code">removeElementAt(<i>index</i>)</span>
<div class=fdef>

Deletes one element from the vector at the given index.  This reduces
the length of the vector by one.  The <i>index</i> value must refer to
an existing element of the vector, or the method throws an error
("index out of range").  Returns <span class="code">self</span>.

<p>If <i>index</i> is negative, it counts from the end of the vector:
-1 is the last element, -2 is the second to last, and so on.

</div>

<p><span class="code">removeRange(<i>startingIndex</i>, <i>endingIndex</i>)</span>
<div class=fdef>

Deletes elements from the vector from <i>startingIndex</i> through and
including <i>endingIndex</i>.  If <i>startingIndex</i> equals
<i>endingIndex</i>, this method simply deletes one element.  This
reduces the length of the vector by the number of elements removed.

<p>Either index (or both) can be negative.  A negative index counts
from the end of the vector: -1 is the last element, -2 is the second
to last, etc.  To delete the last two elements, for example, you
can use <span class="code">vec.removeRange(-2, -1)</span>.

<p>Both <i>startingIndex</i> and <i>endingIndex</i> must refer to
existing elements of the vector, and the ending index must be greater
than or equal to the starting index; if these conditions don't hold,
the method throws an error ("index out of range").

<p>Returns the <span class="code">self</span> object.

</div>

<p><span class="code">setLength(<i>newLength</i>)</span>
<div class=fdef>

Sets the number of elements of the vector to <i>newLength</i>.  If
<i>newLength</i> is smaller than the number of elements currently in
the vector, this discards elements at the end of the vector.  If
<i>newLength</i> is larger than the current size, this adds new
elements and sets their values to <span class="code">nil</span>.  Returns the <span class="code">self</span> object.

</div>

<p><span class="code">sort(<i>descending</i>?, <i>comparisonFunction</i>?)</span>
<div class=fdef>

Re-orders the elements of the vector into sorted order.  By default,
this method sorts the elements of the vector into ascending order, but
you can reverse this ordering by specifying true for the
<i>descending</i> argument.

<p>The optional <i>comparisonFunction</i> can be used to specify the
ordering of the result.  If this argument is not specified (or is
<span class="code">nil</span>), the method will sort the elements according to the standard
system ordering of values; hence, the elements must be of comparable
types (such as all integers or all strings).  By specifying a
comparison function, you can provide your own special ordering, and
you can also sort values that have no system-defined order, such as
object values.

<p>The <i>comparisonFunction</i> works the same way as the for the
<a href='list.htm'>List</a> class's <span class="code">sort()</span> method.

</div>

<a name="splice"></a>
<p><span class="code">splice(<i>idx</i>, <i>del</i>, ...)</span>
<div class=fdef>

Splices elements into the vector, by replacing a given range of elements
with a set of new elements.  <i>idx</i> is the starting index for the splice,
and <i>del</i> is the number of items to delete.  The remaining arguments
are values to be inserted in place of the items deleted.  The method
first deletes <i>del</i> elements from the list starting at <i>idx</i>,
then inserts the remaining arguments as new elements at the same index.
The effect is to replace the <i>del</i> elements starting at <i>idx</i>
with the new list of elements.  The number of new elements can be different
from the number of elements deleted.

<p>If <i>idx</i> is negative, it counts from the end of the vector: -1
is the last element, -2 is the second to last, and so on.  If <i>idx</i>
is zero, the new elements are inserted after the existing last element.

<p>To insert elements without deleting any existing elements, pass
0 for <i>del</i>.  To delete elements without inserting any new elements
in their place, simply omit any additional arguments.

<p>This method modifies the vector in place, and returns <span class="code">self</span>.

<p>You can get the same effect as this method using a combination of
<span class="code">removeRange()</span> and <span class="code">insertAt()</span>.  <span class="code">splice()</span> is clearer and
more concise for cases where you want to replace a range with new
values.  It's also a little more efficient, because it minimizes the
number of copy operations needed to move elements around in the
vector to open and/or close gaps as the size of the vector changes.

</div>

<p><span class="code">subset(<i>func</i>)</span>
<div class=fdef>

Creates and returns a new vector containing the elements of this
vector for which the callback function <i>func</i> returns a non-false
value (i.e., any value other than <span class="code">nil</span> or 0).  For each element of
the source vector, this method invokes the callback function, passing
the value of the current element as the callback function's single
argument.  If the callback returns <span class="code">nil</span> or 0, the method omits the
element from the result; otherwise, the method includes the element in
the result vector.  The new vector's elements will be in the same
order as the selected elements from the source vector.

<p>This method does not modify the original vector.

<p>This example uses a short-form anonymous function to create to
create a new vector that contains only the elements from an original
vector whose values are greater than 10.

<p><div class="code"><pre>
y = x.subset({x: x &gt; 10});
</pre></div>

</div>

<p><span class="code">toList(<i>start</i>?, <i>count</i>?)</span>
<div class=fdef>

Creates and returns a new list value based on the vector.  With no
arguments, the new list has the same number of elements as the
original vector, and each element of the list is a copy of the
corresponding element of the vector.  If <i>start</i> is specified, it
gives the starting index in the vector for the list; elements of the
vector before start are not included in the list.  If <i>count</i> is
specified, it indicates the number of elements of the vector, starting
at start, to copy into the list.

<p>This method is useful when you need to pass a value to a routine
that requires a list value.  Vectors cannot always be passed to
routines requiring list values, so you can use this routine to create
a list with the same values as the vector.

<p>This method does not modify the vector.

</div>

<p><span class="code">valWhich(<i>cond</i>)</span>
<div class=fdef>

Returns the value of the first element for which the callback function
<i>cond</i> returns a non-false value (i.e., any value other than
<span class="code">nil</span> or 0).  The method applies the callback to each element of the
vector, starting with the first, and calls the function for each
element in turn until <i>cond</i> returns a non-false value.  Returns
<span class="code">nil</span> if the callback returns a false value for every element.  This
function is almost the same as <span class="code">indexWhich(<i>cond</i>)</span>, but returns the
value of the first element for which <i>cond</i> returns non-false
rather than the index of the element.  Returns <span class="code">nil</span> if no matching
value is found.

</div>

<h2>Reference Semantics</h2>

<p>The most important distinction between lists and vectors, and the
primary reason to use vectors rather than lists in certain situations,
is that vectors use "reference" semantics, while lists use "value"
semantics.

<p>The difference is that a list's value can never change, but an
vector's value can change.

<p>When you do something that modifies a list, such as assigning a
value to an element of the list, the operation does not change the
list.  Instead, it creates a new list that reflects the change,
leaving the original list unmodified.  TADS automatically updates the
variable that contained the list being indexed so that it contains the
newly-created list.

<p>In contrast, when you assign a new value to an element of an
vector, the vector's value is changed.  No new vector object is
created.

<p>This might seem like a very obscure difference, but it has two
important practical effects.  The first is that operations that modify
vectors are much cheaper to execute, because they don't result in
creating new objects; this means that operations involving a large
number of element changes will run faster with vectors than with
lists.

<p>The second practical difference is that, whenever you change a
vector, the change is visible everywhere the vector is referenced.  In
contrast, when you change a list, the change is visible only to the
code that made the change.

<p>Consider this example:

<p><div class="code"><pre>
local a = [1, 2, 3];
local b = a;

a[2] = 100;
tadsSay(b[2]);
</pre></div>

<p>What will this example display?  At the beginning of the code, we
set a to a list, and then we set b to the value in a, so b refers to
the same list.  So far we have only one object, and both a and b refer
to this single object.  We next assign a new value, 100, to the second
element of a.  As we've seen, this cannot change the list that a
refers to, because lists can never change; so, what we're doing is
creating a new list, copying each element from the original list to
the new list, but changing the second element to reflect the
assignment.  This new list is then assigned to a, so a and b now refer
to different lists.  So, when we display the second element of b, we
see the value "2" displayed, because b still refers to the original,
unmodified list.

<p>Now, consider the same example with an vector:

<p><div class="code"><pre>
local a = new Vector(10, [1, 2, 3]);
local b = a;

a[2] = 100;
tadsSay(b[2]);
</pre></div>

<p>This code looks almost identical, but it displays a different
result than the list version.  We start out by creating a new vector
object and assigning it to a, and then we assign the same value to b.
Next, we assign 100 to the second element of a.  Unlike lists, vectors
can be changed, so this assignment simply replaces the value in the
vector object's second element.  No new vector object is created, so a
and b still refer to the same object.  So, when we display b[2] in
this example, we see the modified value. 

<p>Here's a more interesting example:

<p><div class="code"><pre>
f1()
{
  local a = new Vector(3);

  getInfo(a);
  "Thanks, &lt;&lt;a[1]&gt;&gt;!  This information will allow us to send
  you specially targeted advertising based on your credit
  history! ";
}

getInfo(x)
{
  "Please enter your name: "; x[1] = input();
  "Please enter your age: "; x[2] = toInteger(input());
  "Please enter your social security number: "; x[3] = input();
}
</pre></div>

<p>This is something we couldn't have done with lists: assigning
elements of x in getInfo() wouldn't have affected the caller's copy of
the list, so the routine wouldn't be able to pass back information
this way using lists.

<p>Note that, when you explicitly create a copy of a vector, the new
copy is not affected by any changes to the original:

<p><div class="code"><pre>
x = new Vector(10, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]);
y = new Vector(10, x);

x[3] = 100;
tadsSay(y[3]);
</pre></div>

<p>This example displays the value "3" (not "100"), because x and y
refer to separate objects.  Changing a value in the vector to which x
refers has no effect on the vector to which y refers.
