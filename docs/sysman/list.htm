<h1>List</h1>

<p>"List" is a native TADS 3 datatype.  Lists are actually instances
of the intrinsic class List, which means that you can call methods
defined by the List intrinsic class on list objects.

<h2>Value Semantics</h2>

<p>Lists have "value semantics," which means that a given list value
is immutable.  Any operation that appears to modify a list value is
actually creating a new list value, and leaving the original value
unchanged.  This behavior makes it very easy to work with lists,
because you never have to worry about how many variables or properties
refer to a list - even if several variables refer to a list value,
each variable effectively has its own private copy of the list, so
changes made to one variable's list won't affect any others.  This
also means that you can pass a list to a function without having to
worry about whether the function will modify the list, and similarly
that you can modify a list passed in as an argument to your functions
without having to worry about how the changes will affect the caller.

<p>This is discussed in more detail in the <a href='vector.htm'>Vector</a>
class section.

<h2>String conversions</h2>

<h3>String conversions</h3>

<p>A list can be converted to a string using the
<a href="tadsgen.htm#toString">toString()</a> function.  A list can
also be used in a context where a non-string value is implicitly
converted to a string, such as on the right-hand side of a "+"
operator where the left-hand side is a string.

<p>The string conversion of a list consists of the list's elements,
each itself first converted to a string if necessary, concatenated
together, with commas separating elements.  For example,
<span class="code">toString([1, 2, 3])</span> yields the string <span class="code">'1,2,3'</span>.


<h2>List iterations</h2>

<p>A List is a subclass of <a href='collect.htm'>Collection</a>, so
you can use the <span class="code">createIterator()</span> method to create an Iterator to
iterate over the elements of the list.  The Iterator that a List
creates is called an IndexedIterator, and visits the elements of the
list in index order (the first element visited is the element at index
1, the second is the element at index 2, and so forth).

<h2>List methods</h2>

<p>List is a subclass of <a href='collect.htm'>Collection</a>, and
thus defines the Collection methods.  In addition, List defines the
methods shown below.

<p><span class="code">append(<i>val</i>)</span>
<div class=fdef>

Appends the value <i>val</i> to this list, returning the resulting
list.  This is almost the same as using the <span class="code">+</span> operator to append
<i>val</i> to the list, but differs in that this method always treats
<i>val</i> as a single new element, even if <i>val</i> is a list.
Consider the following:

<p><div class="code"><pre>
local x = [1, 2, 3];
local y = x + [4, 5];
local z = x.append([4, 5]);
</pre></div>

<p>In this example, the value of <span class="code">y</span> is the list <span class="code">[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]</span>:
if the value on the right of a <span class="code">+</span> operator is a list, the <span class="code">+</span> operator
appends each value of the list as a separate element.  In contrast,
the value of <span class="code">z</span> is <span class="code">[1, 2, 3, [4, 5]]</span>, because the <span class="code">append()</span> method
always treats its argument as a single element of the new list.

<p>Note that you can achieve the same effect using the <span class="code">+</span> operator by
constructing a new list for the right operand:

<p><div class="code"><pre>
local y2 = x + [[4, 5]];
</pre></div>

<p>This will ensure that the value of <span class="code">y2</span> is the same as the value of
<span class="code">z</span>: <span class="code">[1, 2, 3, [4, 5]]</span>.  However, the <span class="code">append()</span> method is more efficient
than constructing a new list for the right operand of <span class="code">+</span>, because it's
not necessary to construct the intermediate list using <span class="code">append()</span>.

</div>

<p><span class="code">appendUnique(<i>lst</i>)</span>
<div class=fdef>

Appends the elements of the list <i>lst</i> to this list, returning a
new list consisting only of the unique elements of the combination.
Each value appearing in the result list will appear in the result list
only once.  (The same effect could be obtained by concatenating the
two lists with the <span class="code">+</span> operator then applying <span class="code">getUnique()</span> to the
result, but this method is more efficient because it avoids
constructing the fully concatenated list as an intermediate value.)

</div>

<p><span class="code">car()</span>
<div class=fdef>

Returns the first element of the list.  If the list has no elements,
returns <span class="code">nil</span>.

<p>(The names "car" and "cdr" are historical; they come from the Lisp
programming language, which borrowed them from an old IBM mainframe
instruction set.)

</div>

<p><span class="code">cdr()</span>
<div class=fdef>

Returns the "tail" of the list; that is, the rest of the list after
removing the first element.  If the list has no elements, returns <span class="code">nil</span>.
This function is almost the same as <span class="code">sublist(2)</span>, except that <span class="code">sublist()</span>
would return an empty list if given an empty list, whereas <span class="code">cdr()</span>
returns <span class="code">nil</span> in this case.

<p>(The names "car" and "cdr" are historical; they come from the Lisp
programming language, which borrowed them from an old IBM mainframe
instruction set.)

</div>

<p><span class="code">countOf(<i>val</i>)</span>
<div class=fdef>

Returns the number of elements whose values equal <i>val</i>.

</div>

<p><span class="code">countWhich(<i>cond</i>)</span>
<div class=fdef>

Returns the number of elements for which the callback function
<i>cond</i> returns a non-false value (anything but <span class="code">nil</span> or 0).  For
each element, this method calls the callback, passing the current
element as the argument.  If the callback returns anything but <span class="code">nil</span> or
0, the method counts the element.  After invoking the callback for
each element, the method returns the resulting count.

</div>

<p><span class="code">forEach(<i>func</i>)</span>
<div class=fdef>

Invokes the callback function <span class="code">(<i>func</i>)(<i>value</i>)</span> for each element, in
order from first to last, passing the value of one element as
<i>value</i> to the callback on each invocation.  The callback
function takes one argument, which is the current element, and returns
no value.  This method returns no value.  This method is a convenient
means of executing some code for each element of the list.

</div>

<p><span class="code">forEachAssoc(<i>func</i>)</span>
<div class=fdef>

Invokes the callback function <span class="code">(<i>func</i>)(<i>index</i>, <i>value</i>)</span> for each
element, in order from first to last, passing each element's index and
value to the function <i>func</i>.  The callback function returns no
value.  This method returns no value.  This method is a convenient
means of executing some code for each element of the list; unlike
<span class="code">forEach()</span>, this method provides its callback with the index as well as
the value for each element it visits.

</div>

<a name="generate"></a>
<p><span class="code">generate(<i>func</i>, <i>n</i>)</span>
<div class=fdef>

<p>Creates a new list containing <i>n</i> elements by invoking the
callback function <i>func</i> once for each element, and using the
return value as the element value.  This is a class method that you
call on the List class directly, as in <span class="code">List.generate(f, 10)</span>.

<p><i>func</i> is a callback function, which can be a regular function
or an anonymous function.  <i>func</i> can take zero or one argument.
The one-argument form is invoked with the index of the current element
as the argument on each call.

<p><span class="code">generate()</span> is convenient for creating a list of values based on
a formula.  For example, this creates a list of the first ten positive
even integers:

<p><div class="code"><pre>
local e = List.generate({i: i*2}, 10);
</pre></div>

<p>That creates a list containing ten elements.  Each element's value
is determined by calling the anonymous function <span class="code"> {i: i*2}</span> with
the index of that element.  So the value of the first element, at
index 1, is determined by calling the anonymous function with <span class="code">i=1</span>.
In this case the function returns <span class="code">i*2</span> == <span class="code">1*2</span> == <span class="code">2</span>.  The second
element is determined by calling the function again with <span class="code">i=2</span>, which
returns 4, and so on for the remaining elements.

<p>This creates a list of the first 20 Fibonacci numbers:

<p><div class="code"><pre>
local a = 0, b = 1;
local fib = List.generate({: local f = a, a = b, b = f + a, f }, 20);
</pre></div>

<p>(For a simple way of generating a list consisting of a
repeated fixed value, see the <a href="tadsgen.htm#makeList">makeList()</a>
function.)

</div>

<p><span class="code">getUnique()</span>
<div class=fdef>

Returns a new list consisting of the unique elements of the original
list.  For each value in the original list, the value will appear in
the new list only once.  The order of the elements in the new list is
that of the first appearances of the unique elements of the original
list.  For example, if the original list is <span class="code">[1, 5, 2, 5, 3, 5, 4, 5]</span>,
this method will return <span class="code">[1, 5, 2, 3, 4]</span>.

</div>

<p><span class="code">indexOf(<i>val</i>)</span>
<div class=fdef>

Returns the index of the first element of the list equal to the given
value.  If <i>val</i> does not appear anywhere in the list, the method
returns <span class="code">nil</span>.  The first element is at index 1.

</div>

<p><span class="code">indexOfMax(<i>func</i>?)</span>
<div class=fdef>

If <i>func</i> is omitted, returns the index of the element with the
maximum value, comparing values to one another as though using the
<span class="code">&gt;</span> operator.

<p>If <i>func</i> is specified, it must be a function
pointer.  The method calls <i>func</i>() for each element in the
list, passing the element's value as the function argument.  The
function must return a value.  The result of <span class="code">indexOfMax</span> in this
case is the index of the element for which <i>func</i>() returned
the maximum value.

<p>For example, if <span class="code">lst</span> is a list of string values,
<span class="code">lst.indexOfMax({x: x.length()})</span> returns the index of the
longest string in the list.

</div>

<p><span class="code">indexOfMin(<i>func</i>?)</span>
<div class=fdef>

If <i>func</i> is omitted, returns the index of the element with the
minimum value, comparing values to one another as though using the
<span class="code">&lt;</span> operator.

<p>If <i>func</i> is specified, it must be a function
pointer.  The method calls <i>func</i>() for each element in the
list, passing the element's value as the function argument.  The
function must return a value.  The result of <span class="code">indexOfMin</span> in this
case is the index of the element for which <i>func</i>() returned
the minimum value.

<p>For example, if <span class="code">lst</span> is a list of string values,
<span class="code">lst.indexOfMin({x: x.length()})</span> returns the index of the
shortest string in the list.

</div>

<p><span class="code">indexWhich(<i>cond</i>)</span>
<div class=fdef>

Finds the first element for which the given condition is true.  The
method iterates through the elements of the list, starting at the
first element and proceeding in order, and applies the callback
function <i>cond</i> to each element.  The callback takes one
argument, which is the value of the list element, and returns a
condition result value.  For each element, if the callback function
returns a non-false value (i.e., any value except <span class="code">nil</span> or 0), the
method immediately stops the iteration and returns the index of that
element.  If the callback returns a false value (<span class="code">nil</span> or 0) for
every element of the list, the method returns <span class="code">nil</span>.

</div>

<p><span class="code">insertAt(<i>index</i>, <i>val1</i>, <i>val2</i>, …)</span>
<div class=fdef>

Returns a new list which results from inserting the given values
(<i>val1</i>, <i>val2</i>, and so on) into the existing list before
the element at the position given by <i>index</i>.  At least one value
argument is required; if multiple value arguments are provided, the
values are inserted into the list in the same order in which they
appear in the arguments.

<p>If <i>index</i> is 1, the values are inserted before the first
element of the existing list (this means that <span class="code">insertAt(1, x)</span> is
equivalent to <span class="code">prepend(x)</span>), and if <i>index</i> is equal to the
number of elements in the original list plus 1, the values are
inserted after the last element of the existing list (so
<span class="code">lst.insertAt(lst.length() + 1, x)</span> is equivalent to
<span class="code">lst.append(x)</span>).  If <i>index</i> is negative, it counts backwards
from the end of the list: -1 inserts before the last element, -2
inserts before the second to last, and so on.  If <i>index</i> is
zero, elements are inserted after the existing last element.  

<p>Because the new elements are inserted before any existing element
at the insertion point, the index in the result list of the first
element inserted always equals <i>index</i>.  For example, consider
this statement:

<p><div class="code"><pre>
lst = lst.insertAt(5, 'a', 'b', 'c');
</pre></div>

<p>After this statement is executed, <span class="code">lst[5]</span> will be <span class="code">'a'</span>.

<p>Note that, if any of the values to be inserted are themselves
lists, each one is inserted as a single list-valued element, in the
same manner as <span class="code">append(<i>val</i>)</span> and <span class="code">prepend(<i>val</i>)</span>.

</div>

<p><span class="code">intersect(<i>lst2</i>)</span>
<div class=fdef>

Returns a new list consisting of the intersection of this list and
<i>lst2</i>; that is, a list consisting of the elements common to both
this list and <i>lst2</i>.  <i>lst2</i> must also be a list.  If the
two lists have no elements in common, the result is an empty list.  If
an element of the shorter list (or, if the lists are of equal length,
this list) appears more than once in the shorter list, and that
element value also appears in the longer list, then the element will
be in the result list the same number of times that it is in the
shorter list.  An element repeated in the longer list will not be
repeated in the result list.

</div>

<a name="join"></a>
<p><span class="code">join(<i>sep</i>?)</span>
<div class=fdef>

Returns a string made by concatenating the elements of the list
together in index order.  If <i>sep</i> is provided, it's a string
that's interposed between elements as a separator.  If <i>sep</i> is
omitted, the elements are concatenated with no separation.

<p>Each element is converted to a string using the usual
automatic conversions before it's concatenated.  If an element
can't be converted to string, the method throws an error.

</div>

<p><span class="code">lastIndexOf(<i>val</i>)</span>
<div class=fdef>

Returns the index of the last element in the list whose value equals
<i>val</i>.  If no element in the list equals <i>val</i>, this method
returns <span class="code">nil</span>.

</div>

<p><span class="code">lastIndexWhich(<i>cond</i>)</span>
<div class=fdef>

Returns the index of the last element in the list for which the
callback function <i>cond</i> returns a non-false value (anything
except <span class="code">nil</span> or 0).  This method is similar to <span class="code">indexWhich(<i>cond</i>)</span>,
but scans the list in reverse order, starting at the last element and
working towards the first.  Returns <span class="code">nil</span> if the callback returns
<span class="code">nil</span> or 0 for every element.

</div>

<p><span class="code">lastValWhich(<i>cond</i>)</span>
<div class=fdef>

Returns the value of the last element in the list for which the
callback function <i>cond</i> returns a non-false value.  This method
is similar to <span class="code">lastIndexWhich(<i>cond</i>)</span>, but returns the value of the
matching element rather than its index.  Returns <span class="code">nil</span> if the callback
returns <span class="code">nil</span> or 0 for every element.

</div>

<p><span class="code">length()</span>
<div class=fdef>

Returns the number of elements in the list.

</div>

<p><span class="code">mapAll(<i>func</i>)</span>
<div class=fdef>

For each element of the list, this method invokes the callback
function <i>func</i>, passing the current element as the single
argument, then adds the callback's return value to a new list.  The method
returns the resulting new list, which has the same number of elements
as the original list.  Each element of the returned list contains the
result returned by func for the corresponding element of the original
list.  This method does not modify the original list, but creates a
new list.

<p>Here's an example that creates a new list consisting of multiplying
each element of an original list by 2 (naturally, for this to work,
the original list must consist entirely of integer values):

<p><div class="code"><pre>
x = [1, 2, 3, 4];
y = x.applyAll({x: x*2});
</pre></div>
 
</div>

<p><span class="code">maxVal(<i>func</i>?)</span>
<div class=fdef>

If <i>func</i> is omitted, returns the maximum of the element values
in the list, comparing values to one another as though using the <span class="code">&gt;</span>
operator.

<p>If <i>func</i> is specified, it must be a function
pointer.  The method calls <i>func</i>() for each element in the
list, passing the element's value as the function argument.  The
function must return a value.  The result of <span class="code">maxVal</span> in this
case is the value of the element which maximizes <i>func</i>.
Note that the <b>element value</b> is returned, <i>not</i> the return
value of <i>func</i>.

<p>For example, if <span class="code">lst</span> is a list of string values,
<span class="code">lst.maxVal({x: x.length()})</span> returns the longest string
in the list.

</div>

<p><span class="code">minVal(<i>func</i>?)</span>
<div class=fdef>

If <i>func</i> is omitted, returns minimum of the element values
in the list, comparing values to one another as though using the
<span class="code">&lt;</span> operator.

<p>If <i>func</i> is specified, it must be a function
pointer.  The method calls <i>func</i>() for each element in the
list, passing the element's value as the function argument.  The
function must return a value.  The result of <span class="code">minVal</span> in this
case is the element that minimizes <i>func</i>().
Note that the <b>element value</b> is returned, <i>not</i> the return
value of <i>func</i>.

<p>For example, if <span class="code">lst</span> is a list of string values,
<span class="code">lst.minVal({x: x.length()})</span> returns the shortest
string in the list.

</div>

<p><span class="code">prepend(<i>val</i>)</span>
<div class=fdef>

Returns a new list which results from inserting the value <i>val</i>
before the first element of the existing list.  This method is similar
to <span class="code">append(<i>val</i>)</span>, but this method inserts the new element at the
beginning of the list rather than at the end.  Note that if <i>val</i>
is a list, it is prepended as a single list-valued element.

</div>

<p><span class="code">removeElementAt(<i>index</i>)</span>
<div class=fdef>

Returns a new list which results from deleting the element at the
given index.  For example, <span class="code">[100, 200, 300].removeElementAt(2)</span>
yields <span class="code">[100, 300]</span>.

<p>If <i>index</i> is negative, it counts from the end of the list: -1
is the last element, -2 is the second to last, and so on.  Otherwise,
<i>index</i> must be at least 1 and at most the number of elements in
the list; if <i>index</i> is outside this range, the method throws an
"index out of range" exception.

</div>

<p><span class="code">removeRange(<i>startIndex</i>, <i>endIndex</i>)</span>
<div class=fdef>

Returns a new list which results from deleting the elements starting
at <i>startIndex</i> and ending with (and including) <i>endIndex</i>.
If <i>endIndex</i> equals <i>startIndex</i>, only one value is
deleted, so <span class="code">removeRange(<i>x</i>, <i>x</i>)</span> is equivalent to <span class="code">removeElementAt(<i>x</i>)</span>.

<p>If either index is negative, it counts from the end of the list:
-1 is the last element, -2 is the second to last, and so on.
Otherwise, <i>startIndex</i> and <i>endIndex</i> must be at
least 1 and at most the number of elements in the list, and
<i>endIndex</i> must be greater than or equal to <i>startIndex</i>.

</div>

<a name="sort"></a>
<p><span class="code">sort(<i>descending</i>?, <i>comparisonFunction</i>?)</span>
<div class=fdef>

Returns a new list consisting of the elements of this list rearranged
into a sorted order.  By default, this method sorts the elements of
the list into ascending order, but you can reverse this ordering by
specifying <span class="code">true</span> for the <i>descending</i> parameter.

<p>The optional <i>comparisonFunction</i> can be used to specify the
ordering of the result.  If this argument is not specified (or is
<span class="code">nil</span>), the method will sort the elements according to the standard
system ordering of values; hence, the elements must be of comparable
types (such as all integers or all strings).  By specifying a
comparison function, you can provide your own special ordering, and
you can also sort values that have no system-defined order, such as
object values.

<p>If provided, the <i>comparisonFunction</i> value is a pointer to a
function taking two arguments, which are two values from the list to
be compared.  The function returns an integer less than zero if the
first value is less than the second, zero if the two values are equal,
or an integer greater than zero if the first value is greater than the
second.

<p>For example, if you wanted to sort a list of objects so that the
objects are placed into descending order of their "priority" property
values, where the "priority" property has an integer value, you could
do this:

<p><div class="code"><pre>
lst = [obj1, obj2, obj3];
sortedLst = lst.sort(true, { a, b: a.priority - b.priority });
</pre></div>

</div>

<a name="splice"></a>
<p><span class="code">splice(<i>startIndex</i>, <i>deleteCount</i>, ...)</span>
<div class=fdef>

Returns a new list which results from deleting the <i>deleteCount</i>
elements starting at <i>startIndex</i>, then inserting any additional
argument values as new list elements in their place.  If <i>deleteCount</i>
is zero, no elements are deleted.  If there are no additional arguments,
no new elements are inserted.

<p>If <i>startIndex</i> is negative, it counts from the end of the list:
-1 is the last element, -2 is the second to last, and so on.  Use 0
to indicate one past the last element, to insert the new elements after
the last existing element.

<p>You can get the same effect as this method using a combination of
<span class="code">removeRange()</span> and <span class="code">insertAt()</span>.  <span class="code">splice()</span> is clearer and
more concise for cases where you want to replace a range with new
values.  It's also a little more efficient, since it doesn't have to
construct an extra list to hold the intermediate result between the
deletion and insertion.

</div>


<a name="sublist"></a>
<p><span class="code">sublist(<i>start</i>, <i>length</i>?)</span>
<div class=fdef>

Creates and returns a new list consisting of a sublist of this list
starting at the element of this list at index <i>start</i>, and
continuing for the number of elements given by <i>length</i>, if
present, or to the end of this list if not.  If <i>start</i> is
negative, it counts from the end of the list: -1 is the last element,
-2 is the second to last, and so on.  If <i>length</i> is negative, it
gives the number of items to omit from the end of the result list; -1
omits the last element of the source list, -2 omits the last two
elements, and so on.

<p>Examples:

<p><div class="code"><pre>
[1, 2, 3].sublist(2) yields [2, 3]
[1, 2, 3].sublist(2, 1) yields [2]
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5].sublist(1, -2) yields [1, 2, 3]
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5].sublist(2, -2) yields [2, 3]
</pre></div>

</div>

<p><span class="code">subset(<i>func</i>)</span>
<div class=fdef>

Creates and returns a new list containing the elements of this list
for which the callback function <i>func</i> returns true (i.e., any
value other than <span class="code">nil</span> or 0).  For each element of the
source list, this method invokes the callback function, passing the
value of the current element as the callback function's single
argument.  If the callback returns <span class="code">nil</span> or 0, the
method omits the element from the result; otherwise, the method
includes the element in the result list.  The new list's elements will
be in the same order as the selected elements from the source list.

<p>This method does not modify the original list.

<p>This example uses a short-form anonymous function to create a new
list that contains only the elements from an original list whose
values are greater than 10.

<p><div class="code"><pre>
x = [5, 10, 15, 20];
y = x.subset({x: x &gt; 10});
</pre></div>

</div>

<p><span class="code">valWhich(<i>cond</i>)</span>
<div class=fdef>

Returns the value of the first element for which the callback function
<i>cond</i> returns non-false (i.e., anything except <span class="code">nil</span> or 0).
This method is similar to <span class="code">indexWhich(<i>cond</i>)</span>, but returns the value
of the first matching element rather than its index.  If <i>cond</i>
returns <span class="code">nil</span> or 0 for every element of the list, this method returns
<span class="code">nil</span>.
