<h1>WeakRefLookupTable</h1>

<p>WeakRefLookupTable is a subclass of <a
href='lookup.htm'>LookupTable</a>.  It behaves the same as the regular
LookupTable class, and has the same methods; the only difference is
that the values in a weak-reference table are only "weakly"
referenced.  (The keys are still "strongly" referenced; only the
values are weak references.)

<p>A "weak reference" is a reference that <b>doesn't</b> prevent the
garbage collector from removing the referenced object from memory.  On
each scan of memory, the garbage collector deletes each object it
finds that is not referenced at all, and each object that is
referenced exclusively through weak references.  This means that if an
object is referenced only as a value stored in a WeakRefLookupTable,
the garbage collector can delete the object.  Whenever the garbage
collector deletes an object that is stored as a value in a
WeakRefLookupTable, the WeakRefLookupTable automatically deletes that
key/value pair.

<p>Weak references have their uses, especially in situations where you
want to create a secondary access path to a set of objects for
performance reasons, such as an index or a cache.  These cases are
relatively rare, though, so don't feel that you need to go out of your
way to find places to use this intrinsic class.  If you can't think of
a reason to use this class, just ignore it and use the base
LookupTable class.
