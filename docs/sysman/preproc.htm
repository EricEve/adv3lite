<h1>The Preprocessor</h1>

<p>TADS 3 provides a macro preprocessor that's essentially equivalent
to the standard ANSI C preprocessor.

<p>The preprocessor is effectively a separate phase of processing that
runs before the compiler: the preprocessor's output is the compiler's
input.  The preprocessor works entirely at the textual level; it's not
part of the compiler per se, and it doesn't make any attempt to
understand the underlying TADS language or program structure.

<h2>Lexical structure</h2>

<p>The preprocessor uses all the same lexical rules as the TADS
language: strings are enclosed in single or double quotes; symbols
consist of an alphabetic or underscore character followed by zero or
more alphanumeric or underscore characters; numbers consist of strings
of digits, with periods to indicate decimal points and 'e' or 'E' to
indicate exponents in floating-point values; and various punctuation
marks and combinations of punctuation marks are used as operator
tokens.

<p>Block comments are specified with /* ... */ sequences, and //
begins a comment that runs to the end of the line.  Each comment is
replaced with single space character <b>before</b> any other work is
done.

<p>In addition to the basic TADS lexical structure, the preprocessor
has a couple of special features of its own:

<ul class=doublespace>

<li>If the last character of a source line is "\" (a backslash), the
preprocessor replaces the backslash and the newline that follows with
a single space character.  This effectively joins two physical lines
of the source file into one "logical" line.  This is done before
directives are interpreted, which allows you to write a single
directive that spans multiple physical lines.  Note that this only
takes effect when a "\" is the very last character on the line; if
anything else follows, even whitespace, the backslash is treated as
just part of the source text, and doesn't join the line with the next
one.

<li>"#" at the beginning of a line introduces a preprocessor
directive.  Whitespace can optionally precede the "#" and can come
between the "#" and the directive name.  Each directive is exactly one
<i>logical</i> line long, and runs to the end of the logical line.

</ul>

<h2>Directives</h2>

<p>All preprocessor directives have compilation unit scope.  A few,
such as #pragma newline_spacing, are further limited to the current
include file; exceptions to compilation unit scope are noted with the
individual directive descriptions.


<h3>#charset</h3>

<p>#charset specifies the file's character set.  If this directive is
used, it <b>must</b> be the very first thing in the file.  It can't
be preceded by anything, not even a comment or whitespace.

<p>The syntax is:

<p><div class="syntax"><pre>
<span class=synLit>#charset</span> <span class=synLit>"</span><span class=synPar>name</span><span class=synLit>"</span>
</pre></div>

<p>where <i>name</i> is the character set name.  You can use one of
the built-in character sets ("us-ascii", "latin1") or any of the
available mappings.  On most platforms, the TADS 3 distribution
includes a large set of common mappings, including the ISO-8859-n
character sets, many of the 8-bit Windows code pages, and the
Macintosh sets.

<h3>#define</h3>

<p>This directive defines a macro.  It has two forms: one that defines
a simple constant symbol, and one that defines a function-like macro
with parameters.

<p><div class="syntax"><pre>
<span class=synLit>#define</span> <span class=synPar>simpleMacro</span> <span class=synPar>text</span>
<span class=synLit>#define</span> <span class=synPar>funcMacro</span><span class=synLit>(</span> <span class=synMark>[</span> <span class=synPar>param1</span> <span class=synMark>[</span> <span class=synLit>,</span> <span class=synPar>param2</span> <span class=synMark>...</span> <span class=synMark>]</span>  <span class=synMark>]</span>  <span class=synLit>)</span> <span class=synPar>textWithParameters</span>
</pre></div>

<p>The first form defines a "simple" macro, which simply associates a
symbol name with some replacement text.  Each time the macro symbol
name appears in subsequent source text, it's simply replaced with the
expansion text.

<p>The second form defines a "function-like" macro.  This means that
the macro is syntactically like a function, in that a list of
arguments, enclosed in parentheses, must appear after the macro name
each time it's used.  The parameter list can include zero, one, or
more parameters, separated by commas; each parameter name must be a
symbol token, and a name cannot be repeated within the list.  Whenever
the macro name appears in the source text, it must be followed by a
parenthesized list of values; these values will be substituted into
the replacement text where the names of the parameters appear in the
replacement text.

<p>Note that if you define a parameter list, there must be no whitespace
between the macro symbol name and the open parenthesis.  The parenthesis
must appear <i>immediately</i> after the macro name.

<p>Macro processing is described in more detail <a href='#macros'>below.</a>


<h3>#error</h3>

<p>This macro lets you generate a compiler error with your own custom
message.  The message is displayed on the console in the same format
as an actual compiler message.  This is most useful with conditional
compilation, such as to flag build configurations or module combinations
that you don't wish to allow.

<p>The syntax is:

<p><div class="syntax"><pre>
<span class=synLit>#error</span> <span class=synPar>token</span> <span class=synMark>[</span> <span class=synPar>token2</span> <span class=synMark>...</span> <span class=synMark>]</span> 
</pre></div>

<p>The token list can contain any number of tokens of any kind.
However, note that macro expansion is performed on the line, so
in most cases, you'll want to enclose your message text in quotes
so that it's displayed literally, rather than being expanded into
any macros that happen to match the words in the message text.

<p>Here's an example that checks to make sure an included library
header has a suitable version number:

<p><div class="code"><pre>
#include "MyLib.h"
#if MYLIB_VSN &lt; 5
#error "This module requires MyLib version 5 or higher."
#endif
</pre></div>

<h3>#if, #ifdef, #elif, #else, #endif</h3>

<p>These directives allow you to include or exclude code conditionally.

<p>The syntax of these macros is as follows:

<p><div class="syntax"><pre>
<span class=synLit>#if</span> <span class=synPar>expression</span>
<span class=synLit>#ifdef</span> <span class=synPar>macroName</span>
<span class=synLit>#elif</span> <span class=synPar>expression</span>
<span class=synLit>#else</span>
<span class=synLit>#endif</span>
</pre></div>

<p>The <i>macro</i> of an #ifdef is simply a macro symbol.

<p>The <i>expression</i> of an #if or #elif can evaluate to a string
constant, an integer constant, or the tokens <tt>true</tt> or
<tt>nil</tt>.  You can use the standard arithmetic operators (+, -, *,
/, %, &lt;&lt;, &gt;&gt, !, &amp;, |, &amp;&amp;, ||, ?:) within
integer and boolean expressions.  In addition, the special operator
<tt>defined(<i>macro</i>)</tt> evalutes to 1 if the given macro symbol
is currently defined, 0 if not.  An #if or #elif expression is
considered true if it evaluates to a non-zero integer, or to any
string value, or to the special value <tt>true</tt>.

<p>Each #if or #ifdef must be matched by exactly one #endif.

<p>Within a #if...#endif or #ifdef...#endif block, you can include any
number of #elif directives, and you can optionally include a single
#else directive that follows any #elif directives.  #elif stands for
"else if"; it takes effect only if its expression evaluates to
true <i>and</i> the controlling #if or #ifdef evaluated to false
<i>and</i> all preceding #elif's in the same block evaluated to false.

<p>The preprocessor handles an #if...#endif block as follows.  It
first expands any macros in the expression, then evaluates the
result as a constant expression (taking into account arithmetic
operators).  Then:

<ul class=doublespace>

<li>If the expression evaluates to true (as defined above), the source
text between the #if and the matching #elif, #else, or #endif -
whichever comes first - is retained; all text after the matching #elif
or #else is discarded and replaced with whitespace, up to the matching
#endif.

<li>If, on the other hand, the expression evaluates to false, the
source text between the #if and the matching #elif, #else, or #endif
is discarded and replaced with whitespace.  If the next thing is an
#elif, its condition is evaluated, and the process is repeated as
though it were the original #if.  If the next thing is instead an
#else, the text between the #else and the #endif is retained.

</ul>

<p>#ifdef is handled much the same way, except that its condition is
simply the existence or absence of a definition for the given macro
symbol.  The #ifdef condition is true if the given macro symbol has
been defined, false if not.

<p>Note that there's no such thing as "#elifdef" - that is,
else-if-defined - but you can get the same effect by using "#elif
defined(<i>macro</i>)".

<p>#if and #ifdef blocks can be nested to any depth.

<p>Here's an example 

Note that the defined() preprocessor operator can be used within an
expression in these directives to test to determine if a preprocessor
symbol is defined.  This allows for tests of combinations of defined
symbols:

#if defined(MSDOS) || defined(AMIGA) || defined(UNIX)




<h3>#include</h3>

<p>This directive inserts the contents of another source file into the
compilation unit at the current point.  The contents of the included
file effectively replace the #include directive in the preprocessor
output.

<p>#include has two forms.

<p><div class="syntax"><pre>
<span class=synLit>#include</span> <span class=synLit>"</span><span class=synPar>filename</span><span class=synLit>"</span>
</pre></div>

<p>This form searches for a file with the given name, starting the
search in the directory containing the <i>including</i> file, then in
the directory containing the file that included the including file,
and so on up the list of includers until reaching the original source
file.  We search in this order and stop at the first matching file we
find.  If we still can't find the file after looking in the directory
containing the top-level source file, then we proceed as for an
angle-bracketed file.

<p><div class="syntax"><pre>
<span class=synLit>#include</span> <span class=synLit>&lt;</span><span class=synPar>filename</span><span class=synLit>&gt;</span>
</pre></div>

<p>This form searches for the given file in each directory in the
"include path," as specified in the compiler command options.  For the
command-line t3make program, this is the list of directories specified
with -I options.  The directories are searched in the order of the -I
(or equivalent) options, and we stop and use the first matching file
we find.  If we exhast the include path without finding the file, we
search in the compiler's install directory - this is where the
standard system headers are usually located.

</ul>

<p>In both cases above, if the file still can't be found after
searching all of the directories described, and the filename appears
to be an "absolute" path (according to local path naming conventions,
which vary by system), the compiler tries again, this time treating
the name as an absolute path.  An absolute path is one that fully
specifies the location of the file; on Unix, for example, this is a
path starting with a "/", and on Windows it's a path starting with a
drive specifier (such as "C:").

<p>The file can be specified with a macro symbol or a combination
of macro symbols.  If you use a macro expression, the expansion
must match one of the formats shown above.

<h4>Specifying relative directory paths in include file names</h4>

<p>Filenames in #include directives can refer to relative paths (such
as to subdirectories) using relative URL-style notation.  (A URL is a
"uniform resource locator," which is a World Wide Web standard
mechanism for specifying names of things like files.)  In particular,
you can use a forward slash, "/", as the path separator character,
regardless of your local system's filename conventions.  Even if
you're running on Windows (which uses "\" as the path separator) or
Macintosh (which uses ":" as the separator and has rather different
rules than Unix-style systems), you can use "/" to specify relative
paths, and your source will compile correctly on all systems.

<p>For example, suppose you're using a Macintosh, and you have your
source files in a folder called "My HD:My TADS Games:Caverns of
Gloom".  Now, suppose you decide that you'd like to keep your include
files in a subfolder of this folder called "Include Files".  You could
write your #include lines like so:

<p><div class="code"><pre>
#include ":Include Files:defs.h"
</pre></div>

<p>But if you did this, and then you gave a copy of your source code
to a friend running Windows, your friend wouldn't be able to compile
the code without changing that #include directive to match Windows
path name conventions.

<p>The solution to this problem is to use URL-style path names.  A
URL-style path name works the same on every system, so your friend on
Windows will be able to compile your code without changes if you use
this notation.  To use URL notation, use "/" as the path separator,
and - regardless of local conventions - place slashes only between
path elements, never at the beginning of the filename.  So, we'd
rewrite the example above like this:

<p><div class="code"><pre>
#include "Include Files/defs.h"
</pre></div>

<p>Even though this doesn't look a thing like a Mac path name, the Mac
version of the TADS 3 compiler will happily find your file in the
correct directory, because the Mac version knows how to convert
URL-style path names to the correct Mac conventions, just like the
Windows and Unix versions know how to convert URL-style names to their
own local conventions.

<p>In all include file searches, when the filename looks like a
URL-style path, the compiler takes the following steps to look for the
file.  It takes these steps at each point in the include path search
before moving on to the next directory in the list:

<ul class=doublespace>

<li>First, the compiler tries treating the filename as a URL-style
path.  This means that the compiler converts all "/" characters to the
local path separator characters, and performs any other
transformations required to make the name appear relative.  For
example, on the Mac, the compiler would convert "Include Files/defs.h"
to ":Include Files:defs.h", then would try looking for that file
relative to the current directory being searched.

<li>If the first step fails to find a file, and the file does not use
an absolute path (according to the local file system rules), the
compiler tries again, this time treating the name as a native name,
rather than URL path.  That is, the compiler simply uses the name
exactly as given, without any syntax conversions, and looks for a file
with that name in the directory currently being searched.

</ul>

<p>Even though the compiler accepts local filenames, we strongly
encourage using URL-style filenames for all #include files that
specify paths, since this will ensure that your source code will
compile without changes on other platforms.


<h3>#line</h3>

<p>As the preprocessor reads through the source and include files, it
automatically keeps track of where it is in the file - the filename
and the current line number in the file.  This lets the compiler tell
you where it was looking whenever it encounters a syntax error or
other problem in your code, to make it easier to pinpoint the source
of a problem so you can fix it.

<p>This directive lets you override the compiler's internal notion
of its current position in the source text.  The syntax is:

<p><div class="syntax"><pre>
<span class=synLit>#line</span> <span class=synPar>number</span> <span class=synLit>'</span><span class=synPar>filename</span><span class=synLit>'</span>
</pre></div>

<p>This tells the compiler that it should pretend that it's reading
from the file named <i>file</i> at line number <i>number</i>.

<p>Note that this directive doesn't change where the compiler is
<i>actually</i> reading from.  In particular, it doesn't force
the compiler to jump ahead to a different line in the file, or
change to a different file.  The directive merely overrides the
location that the compiler will <i>report</i> on subsequent error
messages.

<p>The #line directive is mainly of interest to people writing their
own pre-compiler tools.  A pre-compiler is a tool that runs before the
compiler, reading from a user-prepared source file and writing out a
temporary file, and then passing the temporary file to t3make as the
TADS 3 source file.  For tools like this, the #line directive lets the
tool apprise the TADS compiler of the original source code location
associated with the generated code in the temporary file.  This in
turn causes the TADS compiler to report error messages at locations
that will be meaningful to the user.  Since the user is working with
the original pre-compiler input file, it will be a lot more helpful to
report errors in terms of the original input file than in terms of the
temporary file.


<h3>#pragma message</h3>

<p>This directive lets you display a message on the console while
the compiler is running.  The syntax is:

<p><div class="syntax"><pre>
<span class=synLit>#pragma</span> <span class=synLit>message</span> <span class=synLit>(</span> <span class=synPar>token</span> <span class=synMark>...</span> <span class=synLit>)</span>
</pre></div>

<p>Each <i>token</i> can be a single-quoted string, a double-quoted
string, a symbol token, or an integer.  Any macro symbols you use are
expanded as in normal program text.

<h3>#pragma newline_spacing</h3>

<p>Unlike C and Java, a string in TADS 3 doesn't have to fit all on
one line.  You can instead write a string that spans several lines:

<p><div class="code"><pre>
"This is a string
that spans several
lines of source code. ";
</pre></div>

<p>By default, the compiler treats this as though you had written it
all on one line.  It converts each line break into a single space
character.  If a line break is immediately followed by one or more
whitespace characters (spaces, tabs, and so on), the compiler
collapses the line break and all of the subsequent spaces into a
single space character; so each line break turns into a single space,
no matter how many spaces are at the start of the next line.
This is important because most people like to use indentation to make
their source code easier to read; ignoring the leading whitespace on
each extra line within a string means that you don't have to worry
about indentation affecting the appearance of a string.

<p>This default handling is called "collapse" mode, because each
newline and subsequent run of whitespace is collapsed into a single
space.  You can explicitly set this mode by writing this directive
in your source file:

<p><div class="code"><pre>
#pragma newline_spacing(collapse)
</pre></div>

<p>(Prior to TADS 3.1.3, this mode's name was "on" instead of
"collapse".  The compiler still accepts <span class="code">#pragma newline_spacing(on)</span>
as equivalent, so existing code will work without any changes.)

<p>In some written languages, such as Chinese, there isn't typically
any whitespace between words.  In such languages, the normal
"collapse" mode described above isn't convenient, since it introduces
unwanted spacing between words wherever you happen to put a line break
in the source code.  To accommodate languages without inter-word
spacing, the compiler has another newline spacing mode, called
"delete" mode:

<p><div class="code"><pre>
#pragma newline_spacing(delete)
</pre></div>

<p>(The pre-3.1.3 name for this mode was "off", which is also still
accepted and is equivalent to "delete" mode.)

<p>In "delete" mode, when the compiler encounters a line break within
a string, it simply deletes the newline and all immediately subsequent
whitespace.  This mashes the text on the two lines together without
any spacing.

<p>There's one additional mode, "preserve" mode, for times when you
want precise control over the contents of strings.

<p><div class="code"><pre>
#pragma newline_spacing(preserve)
</pre></div>

<p>In "preserve" mode, the compiler keeps the string exactly as you
wrote it, with each line break turning into a <span class="code">\n</span> (newline)
character, and all subsequent spacing left intact.  This can be useful
if you're constructing multi-line strings for special purposes, such
as storing in external files.

<p>The newline_spacing pragma only affects strings following the
pragma in the source file, so you can change the mode at any time
within the same source file.  Whenever you change the mode, the new
mode is in effect until you change it with another pragma, or until
the end of the current source file.  This means that if you change the
mode within a header file, the mode will revert to its previous
setting at the end of the header file.  This lets you #include a file
without worrying about mode changes, because even if the included file
changes the mode, the mode will revert back once the compiler finishes
with the included file.


<h3>#pragma sourceTextGroup</h3>

<p>This directive lets you control the generation of <a
href="objdef.htm#sourceTextGroup">sourceTextGroup</a> property values.
You can also control this with the compiler's "-Gstg" command-line
option, but the #pragma gives you finer-grained control, since it lets
you turn generation on and off within particular modules, or even
within sections of a module.

<p>To turn on sourceTextGroup generation, include this directive
in your source code:

<p><div class="code"><pre>
#pragma sourceTextGroup(on)
</pre></div>

<p>This tells the compiler to generate sourceTextGroup values for
objects defined after this point in the current module's source
code.

<p>You can turn sourceTextGroup generation off with this directive:

<p><div class="code"><pre>
#pragma sourceTextGroup(off)
</pre></div>

<p>This disables sourceTextGroup generation for subsequent
object definitions.

<p>Note that the effect of <tt>#pragma sourceTextGroup</tt> lasts only
within the source module where it appears.  The directive doesn't
carry over to other modules that are part of the same build - at the
start of each new module, the compiler resets to the status specified
in the command line makefile (off by default, or on if the "-Gstg"
option is specifed).


<h3>#pragma once</h3>

<p>This directive adds the current file (i.e., the file in which
the #pragma directly appears) to the "once-only" list.  After a
file is in the once-only list, subsequent #include directives
that attempt to include the file will be ignored.

<p>This is sometimes useful to ensure that a header file isn't
included redundantly.  For example, suppose you are creating a library
that has several header files for different subsystems in the library,
and all of these main subsystem headers in turn depend on a common
header for the overall library.  Each of the subsystem headers would
need to #include the common header.  However, you can't predict in
advance which of the subsystem headers a user might need to #include
in her own program: the user might want to include only one of your
subsystem headers, but also might be using several of your subsystems
and thus would need to include several of the headers.  That's where
the problem comes up: if the user includes three of your subsystem
headers, and each of the subsystem headers includes the common header,
the common header will end up being included three times.  This could
cause compiler errors due to the repeated inclusions of the
definitions in the common header.  You can avoid this by putting a
"#pragma once" directive in the common header; if you do this, it will
ensure that only the first inclusion of the file will have any effect,
and the subsequent redundant inclusions will be harmlessly ignored.

<p>Note that C/C++ programmers usually solve this same problem by
enclosing the entire contents of each header file in a protective
series of #ifdef-type directives.  Each header file follows this
pattern:

<p><div class="code"><pre>
#ifndef MY_HEADER_NAME_H
#define MY_HEADER_NAME_H

// the rest of the contents of the header go here

#endif
</pre></div>

<p>The idea is that, the first time this file is included, the
preprocessor symbol MY_HEADER_NAME_H (which is usually based on the
name of the header file: for myheader.h, we'd use MYHEADER_H) will be
undefined, so the #ifndef ("if not defined") would succeed.  Thus,
everything between the #ifndef and the matching #endif would be
compiled, including the #define for the same symbol.  If the same file
is included again, MY_HEADER_NAME_H would be defined this time,
because of the #define that got compiled the first time around; so the
#ifndef would fail, so the compiler would skip everything up to the
matching #endif.


<h3>#pragma all_once</h3>

<p>This directive turns "all-once" mode on or off.  "#pragma all_once +"
turns all-once mode on, and "#pragma all_once -" turns it off.

<p>By default, all-once mode is off.  When all-once mode is on,
the preprocessor automatically adds each included file to the once-only
list at the moment when the #include for the file is encountered.

<p>Once activated, all-once mode remains in effect until explicitly
turned off.

<h3>#undef</h3>

<p>This directive deletes - "undefines" - a macro that was previously
defined.  This is useful because it lets you redefine a macro with
a new value.  The syntax is:

<p><div class="syntax"><pre>
<span class=synLit>#undef</span> <span class=synPar>macroName</span>
</pre></div>

<p>It's perfectly legal to undefine a macro that was never defined.
This is silently ignored; it doesn't even generate a warning.

<h2 id="macros">Macros</h2>

<h3>Substitution parameters</h3>

<p>When you define a macro with a parameter list, any occurrences
of the parameter names in the macro's expansion text are replaced
with the actual values in each usage of the macro.

<p>For example, suppose we define this macro:

<p><div class="code"><pre>
#define ERROR(msg)  tadsSay('An error occurred: ' + msg + '\n')
</pre></div>

<p>Now suppose we write this in our code somewhere:

<p><div class="code"><pre>
ERROR('invalid value');
</pre></div>

<p>During compilation, the preprocessor will expand this macro
invocation, substituting the actual parameter value when msg appears
in the replacement text.  The resulting expansion is:

<p><div class="code"><pre>
tadsSay('An error occurred: ' + 'invalid value' + '\n');
</pre></div>

<p>(It is worth pointing out that the compiler will subsequently compute
the constant value of this string concatenation, so this will not
result in any string concatenation at run-time.)

<h3>Macros referencing macros</h3>

<p>It's perfectly legal for a macro's expansion text to refer to
other macros.

<p>Macro references within a macro's definition are expanded when a
macro is <i>expanded</i>, rather than when it's defined.  This is
important, because it means that a macro's full, final expansion isn't
set in stone at the moment the macro is defined.  It's not until the
macro is actually used that the full implications of its expansion can
be known.  What's more, different occurrences of the same macro could
have radically different expansions due to changes in the other macros
that the first macro references.

<p>Here's how this works: each time the preprocessor expands a
macro - that is, substitutes the macro's definition for an occurrence
of the macro name in the source text - the preprocessor "re-scans"
the expansion text to see if it contains any macros that need to
be expanded.

<p>For example, consider the following:

<p><div class="code"><pre>
#define SUM(a, b)  (VAL(a) + VAL(b))
#define VAL(a)     (a)

local x = SUM(1, 2);

#undef VAL
#define VAL(a)     (-(a))

local y = SUM(1, 2);
</pre></div>

<p>There are two important things to note about this example.  The
first is that our macro SUM references a macro named VAL that isn't
even defined yet at the point where SUM is defined.  This is perfectly
okay, because of the delayed expansion behavior: since we won't try
to expand macros in SUM's definition until SUM is actually used, it
doesn't matter whether or not VAL is defined at the point where SUM
is defined.  The second thing to notice is that we redefine VAL
before using SUM for the second time.  Since SUM's expansion is
re-scanned for other macros each and every time it's used, this means
that we've effectively changed the definition of SUM when we change
the definition of VAL.

<p>The code above will expand as follows:

<p><div class="code"><pre>
local x = ((1) + (2));
local y = ((-(1)) + (-(2)));
</pre></div>


<h3>Recursive macros</h3>

<p>Despite the re-scanning rule for macro expansion, the preprocessor
doesn't expand macros recursively - that is, if a macro's expansion
contains a mention of the macro's own name, the recursive self-reference
is <i>not</i> expanded.  Similarly, the preprocessor won't expand
circular references, where macro A's expansion contains macro B,
and macro B's expansion contains macro A.

<p>There's no rule against writing a recursive-<i>looking</i> macro.
Rather, the prohibition on recursion is embodied in the ANSI C rules
of macro expansion.  Basically, when a macro is being expanded, the
preprocessor temporarily "forgets" the macro, then remembers it again
as soon as the expansion is finished.  So, for example, suppose you
write this:

<p><div class="code"><pre>
#define hello(x) hello((x)+1)
</pre></div>

<p>This macro <i>looks</i> like it would expand forever.  If we wrote
hello(1), we'd naively expect this to expand to hello((1)+1), which
would in turn expand to hello(((1)+1)+1), then to
hello((((1)+1)+1)+1), and so on <i>ad infinitum</i>.  However, the
rule against recursive macros prevents this.  Instead, the
preprocessor simply forgets about the definition of hello() while
expanding it, so we simply get hello((1)+1) - and then we're done.

<p>The TADS 3 preprocessor uses the detailed ANSI C rules with regard
to recursive and circular macro definitions.  These rules are quite
complex and only rarely come into play in real-world situations, so we
won't try to explain them in full here.  Instead, we invite authors
who feel the need to know the full gory details to refer to an ANSI C
programming book.


<h3>Macros with variable-length argument lists</h3>

<p>A macro can be defined to take a varying number of arguments, which
is especially useful when the macro calls a function or method with a
varying number of parameters.  Although the 1999 ANSI C specification
includes a varying macro argument feature, the ANSI C version is quite
limited.   TADS 3 diverges here from the ANSI definition to provide a
more powerful facility.

<p>To define a macro with varying arguments, place an ellipsis ("...")
immediately after the last parameter in the macro's formal parameter
list:

<p><div class="code"><pre>
#define ERROR(msg, args...) displayError('Error:', msg, args)
</pre></div>

<p>The "..." after the last argument tells the preprocessor that the
macro allows zero or more arguments in place of the last parameter, so
the ERROR() macro defined above will accept one or more arguments.
We call this the "varying argument" - this single parameter name
stands in for zero, one, or more actual arguments each time the
macro is used.

<h4>Simple expansion with the variable list parameter</h4>

<p>During expansion, the parameter name of the varying argument will
be replaced by the entire varying part of the argument list, including
the commas between adjacent arguments, but not including the comma
before the first varying argument.  For example:

<p><div class="code"><pre>
#define VAR(a, b...) { b }
</pre></div>

<p>This macro will expand as follows:

<p><div class="code"><pre>
VAR(1) expands to { }
VAR(1,2) expands to { 2 }
VAR(1,2,3,4) expands to { 2,3,4 }
</pre></div>

<h4>Expansion with no variable arguments, and deleting the extra comma</h4>

<p>If the varying part of the list contains zero arguments, note that
it is replaced by nothing at all.  In some cases, this can be
problematic; for example, in the ERROR macro defined above, consider
this expansion:

<p><div class="code"><pre>
ERROR('syntax error') -&gt; displayError('Error:', 'syntax error', )
</pre></div>

<p>Note the extra comma after the last argument to displayError - the
comma is from the original expansion text in the macro definition, not
from the parameter "args", which is empty in this case because no
varying arguments were supplied.  The extra comma will cause a syntax
error when the function call is compiled, so the macro as written is
not compatible with an empty varying argument list, even though the
preprocessor will allow it.

<p>To correct this problem, we can use a special feature of the
token-pasting operator (described in more detail below), "##".  This
operator has a special meaning when it appears after a comma and
before a varying-argument macro parameter: when (and only when) the
varying list is empty, the "##" operator deletes the preceding comma.
This only works with commas - if anything else precedes the "##"
operator, the operator works as it would in normal (non-varying
arguments) cases.  We can use this feature to rewrite the ERROR macro:

<p><div class="code"><pre>
#define ERROR(msg, args...) displayError('Error:', msg, ## args)
</pre></div>

<p>Now when we expand this macro with no additional arguments, the
extra comma is deleted:

<p>ERROR('syntax error') expands to displayError('Error:', 'syntax error')<br>
ERROR('token error', 1) expand to displayError('Error:', 'token error', 1)

<p>(In case you're wondering where this bizarre kludge came from, the
idea is borrowed from the Gnu C compiler, which has the same feature.
It's not some random thing we invented, even though it might look that
way.  It's a reasonably simple solution for the most common case, and
it doesn't seem to create any significant complications for other
cases, so we included support for it.  Read on for our more general
alternative approach, though.)

<h4>Iterative expansion with #foreach</h4>

<p>The comma-deleting feature of the "##" operator is useful as far as
it goes, but sometimes it's necessary to construct more elaborate
expansions from varying arguments.  For example, suppose we wanted to
concatenate the arguments to the ERROR macro together - in other
words, we'd like the expansion to look like this:

<p>ERROR('token error', 1, 2) expands to
   displayError('Error:' + 'token error' + 1 + 2)

<p>This is clearly beyond the scope of what we've seen so far.
Fortunately, the TADS 3 preprocessor has another feature that makes
this sort of construction possible: the #foreach operator.  This
operator must immediately follow - with no intervening spaces - the
varying argument name, and must be immediately followed with a
"delimiter" character.  Following the delimiter is the main iteration
expansion, which ends at the next instance of the delimiter character.
Following the second delimiter is the "interim" expansion, which
itself ends at the next instance of the delimiter.

<p>You can choose any non-symbol character for the delimiter, as long
as it doesn't appear in any of the expansion text - a non-symbol
character is anything that can't appear in a symbol, specifically
alphabetic characters, numerals, and underscores.  The point of
letting you choose your own delimiter is to allow you to use anything
in the expansion text by choosing a delimiter that doesn't collide
with the expansion.

<p>Note that you should be careful if you choose a forward slash ("/")
as the delimiter - the preprocessor removes comments before processing
macros, so if you have an empty section, the compiler will completely
remove two consecutive slashes because it will think it indicates a
comment.  You're probably better off avoiding using "/" as the
delimiter.

<p>This sounds a bit complicated, so let's see an example:

<p><div class="code"><pre>
#define ERROR(msg, arg...) displayError('Error: ' + msg arg#foreach: +arg ::)
</pre></div>

<p>The first part of the macro is simple:

<p><div class="code"><pre>
displayError('Error: ' + msg
</pre></div>

<p>This part expands in the familiar way.  Now we come to this sequence:

<p><div class="code"><pre>
arg#foreach: +arg ::
</pre></div>

<p>Remember that the #foreach operator must appear immediately after
the varying argument name, as we see here.  After the #foreach
operator, we have the delimiter; in this case, we've chosen ":", since
we don't need any colons in our expansion text.  We could just as well
have chosen any other character; all that matters is that we don't
need the character anywhere in our expansion, since the next
appearance of this character terminates the expansion.

<p>So, we have two sub-parts, delimited by colons.  The first subpart
is " +arg ", and the second subpart is empty.

<p>The first subpart is the main iteration expansion.  The
preprocessor expands this part once for each actual varying argument,
expanding the varying argument name in this part to merely the current
argument in the varying list.  In the rest of the macro, remember that
the varying argument name expands to the full varying list; in a
#foreach, though, the varying argument name expands merely to the
single, current argument.

<p>The second subpart is the interim iteration expansion.  The
preprocessor expands this part once for each actual varying argument
except for the last one.  This is why we call it the "interim"
expansion - it's expanded between iterations.

<p>Let's look at how the macro expands.  Consider this invocation:

<p><div class="code"><pre>
ERROR('syntax error')
</pre></div>

<p>In this case, we have no varying arguments at all, so the entire
#foreach sequence - from the "arg#foreach" part to the final colon -
is iterated zero times, and hence expands to nothing at all.  The
expansion is thus:

<p><div class="code"><pre>
displayError('Error:' + 'syntax error' )
</pre></div>

<p>Note that we don't have any problem handling the zero varying
arguments, since the entire iteration simply occurs zero times in this
case.

<p>Now consider what happens when we include some arguments:

<p><div class="code"><pre>
ERROR('token error', 1, 2)
</pre></div>

<p>This time, the #foreach sequence is iterated twice.  The first
time, "arg" expands to "1", since that's the first varying argument,
and the second time, "arg" expands to "2".  The two iterations are
expanded like this:

<p><div class="code"><pre>
+1
+2
</pre></div>

<p>These are concatenated together, so the result looks like this:

<p><div class="code"><pre>
displayError('Error: ' + 'token error' +1 +2)
</pre></div>

<p>The "interim" portion is useful for solving the same kinds of
problems as the "##" comma deletion feature, but is more general.
Since the interim portion appears only between each adjacent pair of
varying arguments, it is useful for building lists of zero or more
arguments.  For example, suppose we want to write a macro that adds
zero or more values:

<p><div class="code"><pre>
#define ADD(val...) val#foreach:val:+:
</pre></div>

<p>If we call this with no arguments, the expansion will be empty,
because we'll iterate the #foreach zero times.  If we call this with
one argument, the result will simply be the argument: we'll iterate
the #foreach one time, but we won't include the interim expansion at
all, because we skip the interim expansion after the last argument.
With two arguments, we'll expand the interim once, between the two.
Here are some sample expansions:

<p><div class="code"><pre>
ADD() expands to nothing
ADD(1) expands to 1
ADD(1,2) expands to 1+2
ADD(1,2,3) expands to 1+2+3
</pre></div>

<h4>Conditional expansion with #ifempty and #ifnempty</h4>

<p>In some cases, it's necessary to include a block of text
immediately before or after the variable arguments, but only when the
argument list is non-empty.  In other cases, it's necessary to provide
some text instead of the variable arguments when the variable argument
list is empty.  A pair of operators, #ifempty and #ifnempty, provide
these types of conditional expansion.

<p>The #ifempty and #ifnempty operators are similar in syntax to
#foreach: these operators must appear in macro expansion text directly
after the name of the variable argument formal parameter, with no
intervening spaces, and the operator is immediately followed by a
delimiter character.  After the delimiter comes the conditional
expansion text, which is terminated by another copy of the delimiter
character.

<p>#ifempty includes its expansion text in the macro's expansion only
when the variable argument list is empty, and #ifnempty includes the
text only when the variable argument list is non-empty.

<p>For example, suppose you want to define a macro that expands its
variable arguments into a concatenated list, and then passes the
concatenated list as the second argument to another function.  We
might try defining this using #foreach:

<p><div class="code"><pre>
#define CALL_CONCAT(firstArg, args...) \
   myFunc(firstArg, args#foreach#args#+#)
</pre></div>

<p>However, this has a problem: if the varying argument part of the
list is empty, we have an unnecessary comma in the expansion:

<p><div class="code"><pre>
CALL_CONCAT(test) -&gt; myFunc(test, )
</pre></div>

<p>This is similar to the problem that we mentioned earlier in
describing the "##" operator, but we can't use the "##" operator to
delete the comma in this case, because the "##" comma deletion works
only when the variable list argument appears directly after the ", ##"
sequence.

<p>This is where the #ifempty and #ifnempty operators come in.  In
this case, we want to include the comma after firstArg in the
expansion only when the argument list isn't empty, so we can change
the macro like this:

<p><div class="code"><pre>
#define CALL_CONCAT(firstArg, args...) \
   myFunc(firstArg args#ifnempty#,# args#foreach#args#+#)
</pre></div>

<p>This does what we want: when the variable argument list is empty,
the #ifnempty expansion text is omitted, so we have no extra comma;
when we have one or more varying arguments, the #ifnempty expansion is
included, so the comma is included in the expansion.

<h4>Getting the variable argument count with #argcount</h4>

<p>There's one more feature for varying argument lists: you can obtain
the number of varying arguments with the #argcount operator.  Like
#foreach, the #argcount operator must appear immediately after the
name of the varying parameter, without any spaces.  This operator
expands to a token giving the number of arguments in the varying list.
For example:

<p><div class="code"><pre>
#define MAKELIST(ret, val...) ret = [val#argcount val#foreach#,val##]
</pre></div>

<p>This expands as follows:

<p>MAKELIST(lst)  expands to lst = [0]<br>
MAKELIST(lst, 'a') expands to lst = [1,'a']<br>
MAKELIST(lst, 'a', 'b') expands to lst = [2,'a','b']

<p>Note that #argcount expands to the number of arguments in the
varying part of the list only, and doesn't count any fixed arguments.

<h3>Stringizing</h3>

<p>It's sometimes useful to write a macro that uses the actual text
of a substitution parameter as a string constant.  This can be
accomplished using the "stringizing" operators.  The # operator, when
it precedes the name of a macro formal parameter in macro expansion
text, is replaced by the text of the actual argument value enclosed in
double quotes.  The #@ operator has a similar effect, but encloses the
text in single quotes.  For example, suppose we wanted to write a
debugging macro that displays the value of an arbitrary expression:

<p><div class="code"><pre>
#define printval(val) tadsSay(#@val + ' = ' + toString(val))
</pre></div>

<p>We could use this macro in our code like this:

<p><div class="code"><pre>
printval(MyObject.codeNum);
</pre></div>

<p>This would expand as follows:

<p><div class="code"><pre>
tadsSay('MyObject.codeNum' + ' = ' + toString(MyObject.codeNum));
</pre></div>

<h3>Token Pasting</h3>

<p>In some cases, it's useful to be able to construct a new symbol out
of different parts.  This can be accomplished with "token pasting,"
which constructs a single token from what were originally several
tokens.  The token pasting operator, ##, when it appears in a macro's
expansion text, takes the text of the token to the left of the
operator and the text of the token to the right of the operator and
pastes them together to form a single token.  If the token on either
side is a formal parameter to the macro, the operator first expands
the formal parameter, then performs pasting on the result.

<p>For example, suppose we wanted to construct a method call based on
a partial method name:

<p><div class="code"><pre>
#define callDo(verb, actor)  do##verb(actor)
</pre></div>

<p>We could use the macro like this:

<p><div class="code"><pre>
dobj.callDo(Take, Me);
</pre></div>

<p>This would expand into this text:

<p><div class="code"><pre>
dobj.doTake(Me);
</pre></div>

<p>The preprocessor scans a pasted token for further expansion, so if
the pasted token is itself another macro, the preprocessor expands
that as well:

<p><div class="code"><pre>
#define PASTE(a, b) a##b
#define FOOBAR 123
PASTE(FOO, BAR)
</pre></div>

<p>The macro above expands as follows.  First, the preprocessor
expands the PASTE macro, pasting the two arguments together to yield
the token FOOBAR.  The preprocessor then scans that and finds that
it's another macro, so it expands it.  The final text is simply 123.

<p>Token pasting only works within macro expansion text; the token
pasting operator is ignored if it appears anywhere outside of a
#define.

<h4>String Concatenation</h4>

<p>When you use the ## operator to paste two tokens together, the
preprocessor checks to see if both of the tokens being pasted together
are strings of the same kind (i.e., they both have the same type of
quotes).  If they are, the preprocessor combines the strings by
removing the closing quote of the first string and the opening quote
of the second string.

<p>If either operand of the ## operator is itself modified by the #
operator, the preprocessor first applies the # operator or operators,
and then applies the ## operator.  So, if you paste together two
stringized parameters, the result is a single string.

<p>Here are some examples:

<p><div class="code"><pre>
#define PAREN_STR(a) "(" ## a ")"
#define CONCAT(a, b) a ## b
#define CONCAT_STR(a, b) #a ## #b
#define DEBUG_PRINT(a) "value of " ## #a ## " = &lt;&lt;a&gt;&gt;"

1: PAREN_STR("parens")
2: CONCAT("abc", "def")
3: CONCAT_STR(uvw, xyz)
4: DEBUG_PRINT(obj.prop[3])
</pre></div>

<p>After preprocessing, the file above would appear as follows:

<p><div class="code"><pre>
1: "(parens)"
2: "abcdef"
3: "uvwxyz"
4: "value of obj.prop[3] = &lt;&lt;obj.prop[3]&gt;&gt;"
</pre></div>

<p>Note that string concatenation is a TADS extension, and is not
found in ANSI C preprocessors.  The C preprocessor doesn't provide a
way of combining string tokens because the C language (not the
preprocessor, but the language itself) has a different way of
accomplishing the same thing: in C, two adjacent string tokens are
always treated as a single string formed by concatenating the two
strings together.  The TADS language doesn't allow this kind of
implicit string pasting, because (unlike in C) there are times when it
is valid to use two or more adjacent string tokens, such as in
dictionary property lists.  The TADS preprocessor therefore provides
its own mechanism for concatenating string tokens.

<h4>Pre-defined Macros</h4>

<p>The compiler provides several pre-defined macros that you can
use to get information about the compilation environment.  Note that
these macros are defined by the <b>compiler</b> - they don't necessarily
tell you anything about the run-time environment, since they're fixed
at compile time, and don't change while the program is running.

<p><b>__DEBUG</b> is defined as 1 for debug-mode builds, and is undefined
for release-mode builds.  This means that you can use <tt>#ifdef __DEBUG</tt>
to conditionally include code for debug builds only, excluding the
code for versions that you release to users.  The Adv3 library uses
this feature to include some debugging verbs in games only in
debug builds, so that the verbs are available while you're testing
the game but won't be included in releases.

<p><b>__TADS_SYSTEM_NAME</b> is defined as a symbol giving the name of
the operating system where the compiler is running.  (Note that this
only tells you where you <b>compiled</b> your program - it doesn't
tell you which system the program is actually executing on at
run-time.)  This varies by operating system; on Windows, it's WIN32.

<p><b>__TADS_SYS_xxx</b> is defined as 1, where <b>xxx</b> is the
current operating system symbol defined for __TADS_SYSTEM_NAME.  For
example, when compiling on Windows, __TADS_SYS_WIN32 is defined as 1.

<p><b>__TADS_VERSION_MAJOR</b> is the major version number of the
compiler - this will always be 3 for TADS 3.

<p><b>__TADS_VERSION_MINOR</b> is the minor version number.  This is
the second element of the dotted version string for the compiler: for
example, for TADS 3.0.15, this is 0; for 3.11.22, this would be 11.

<p><b>__TADS3</b> is defined as 1.  This provides an easy way to
detect that the compiler is a TADS 3 compiler (as opposed to a
TADS 2 compiler, say).  (This is essentially
redundant with __TADS_SYSTEM_MAJOR, except that if for some reason you
wanted to write single-sourced code that compiled under TADS 2 and
TADS 3, using conditional compilation to handle the syntax differences
in the languages, you wouldn't have been able to use
__TADS_SYSTEM_MAJOR, because TADS 2 doesn't have an equivalent of the
#if feature for macro expression evaluation.)

<p><b>__DATE__</b> is defined as a single-quoted string giving the
date at which the compilation started, in the format 'MMM dd yyyy',
where MMM is the three-letter month abbreviation, dd is the day of
the month in a two-digit format, and yyyy is the four-digit year.
For example, August 15, 2008 would be represented as 'Aug 15 2008'.

<p><b>__TIME__</b> is defined as a single-quoted string giving the
time at which compilation started, in the format 'hh:mm:ss', where
hh is the two-digit hour on the 24-hour clock (midnight is 00, noon
is 12, eleven PM is 23, etc.), mm is the two-digit minute of the
hour, and ss is the two-digit second within the minute.  For example,
half past noon is represented as '12:30:00'.

<p><b>__LINE__</b> is a always defined as the current line number
within the current source file that the compiler is scanning.  The
line numbering starts at 1 in each file, and increases by 1 at each
newline (usually a carriage-return, line-feed, or combination of the
two, depending on local conventions).

<p><b>__FILE__</b> is always defined as a single-quoted string
giving the name of the source file that the compiler is scanning.

<p>__FILE__ and __LINE__ sometimes come in handy for debugging
purposes, since they let you flag the source file location of a
particular bit of code for examination at run-time.  This is
especially useful within macros, because __FILE__ and __LINE__ are
always expanded at the last possible moment - if you use them
within a macro, they won't be expanded until the containing macro is
itself expanded, which means they'll yield the source location of the
code that ultimately invoked the macro rather than the location of the
definition of the macro.
