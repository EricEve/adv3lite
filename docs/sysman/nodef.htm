<h1>Replacing the Standard Library</h1>

<p>The standard startup module that defines _main(), PreinitObject,
and so on, is called _main.t.  By default, the compiler includes this
in every build automatically.  Most programs will have no reason to
modify the default versions provided in _main.t, which is why t3make
includes the file in all builds by default.  However, if you do need to
replace this module, you can use the -nodef compiler option to tell
the compiler not to include this default module.  If you do this,
you'll minimally need to define the _main() and _mainRestore()
functions yourself.

<p>Most programs also explicitly include system.tl in their project
files.  This is the full system library, which includes definitions
for required support classes for the <a href='file.htm'>File</a> and
<a href='gramprod.htm'>GrammarProd</a> intrinsic classes, as well as
the <a href='tok.htm'>Tokenizer</a> class.  You can eliminate this
module from your build simply by removing system.tl from the list
of files in your project.  If you do this, you'll have to define
your own versions of the support classes for File and GrammarProd,
if you use those classes.
