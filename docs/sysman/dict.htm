<h1>Dictionary</h1>

<p>To facilitate command parsing, TADS 3 provides an intrinsic class
called Dictionary.  A Dictionary is a specialized type of lookup
table designed specifically to work with the <a
href='gramprod.htm'>GrammarProd</a> intrinsic class, which is used to
create parsers.  A Dictionary stores the vocabulary for a grammar;
more generically speaking, it stores associations between keys and
objects, and can be efficiently searched for a key to yield all of the
objects associated with the key.

<p>A "key" is a combination of a string and a property ID.  The
Dictionary class includes a property ID with each key so that object
associations can be differentiated by type; each property is a type of
association.  In practical terms, the property used in a Dictionary
key will usually be a vocabulary property, such as <span class="code">noun</span> or
<span class="code">adjective</span>.  A given word might be used with some objects as a noun,
but with other objects as an adjective; for example, "card" might be
used as a noun with an "ID Card" object, but as an adjective with a
"card slot" object.  The Dictionary class differentiates by property
ID to allow for searching a Dictionary object for the objects matching
a word in a particular usage context.

<p>To use the Dictionary class, you should <span class="code">#include &lt;dict.h&gt;</span>.
If you're using the adv3 library, the library headers will do this for you
automatically.

<h2>Comparators</h2>

<p>The Dictionary class allows the program to customize the way input
strings are matched to dictionary strings.  This customization is
handled through a "comparator" object; this is simply an object that
provides a specific set of methods, which the Dictionary calls to
perform its comparisons.

<p>You can set a Dictionary object's comparator at any time by calling
the Dictionary's <span class="code">setComparator()</span> method.  This method takes the
comparator object as an argument.  When you set the comparator,
subsequent look-up operations are performed using the matching rules
contained in the new comparator.

<p>The intrinsic class <a href='strcomp.htm'>StringComparator</a>
provides a customizable comparator implementation, compatible with the
Dictionary requirements, that's very fast (since it's implemented as
native code in the interpreter).  When the StringComparator class
doesn't provide enough flexibility, you can define your own completely
custom comparator by implementing the set of required methods.

<p>The Dictionary class assumes that comparator objects are immutable.
That is, once a comparator is installed in a dictionary, the
dictionary assumes that the return values from the required methods,
for a given set of argument values, will never change.  This is
important because it allows the dictionary to assume it will never
need to rebuild its internal tables except when a new comparator is
installed.  If you want to change the comparison rules, you must
create and install a new comparator object; never attempt to change
the comparison rules by modifying the comparator itself.

<p>A comparator object must define the following methods:

<p><span class="code">calcHash(<i>str</i>)</span>
<div class=fdef>

Calculate and return the "hash code" for the given string <i>str</i>.
The hash code is simply an arbitrary integer value; its purpose is to
allow the dictionary to divide its overall set of words into many
bins, which reduces the amount of work necessary when searching for a
particular string by limiting the search to the strings in one bin.
When storing a string, the dictionary computes the hash value by
calling this method, then stores the string in a bin specified by the
hash value.  When looking up a string, the dictionary computes the
string's hash value, and then only has to look in the bin given by the
hash value.

<p>Note that this function doesn't have to worry about how many bins
the dictionary is using.  The dictionary will automatically take the
value modulo the bin count (i.e., the dictionary will divide the value
returned from calcHash() by the number of bins, and use the integer
remainder of this division to select the bin; this will inherently be
in the correct range).

<p>The hash value returned from this method is arbitrary, hence the
method can implement any algorithm it wants for computing the value.
However, there is one absolute requirement that the method must obey,
and a couple of properties that the algorithm should have:

<ul class=doublespace>

<li>The absolute requirement is that, for any two strings <i>s1</i>
and <i>s2</i>, if <span class="code">matchValues(s1, s2)</span> indicates a match (i.e., it
returns anything other than zero or <span class="code">nil</span>), then <span class="code">calcHash(s1)</span>
must equal <span class="code">calcHash(s2)</span>.  (This does <b>not</b> imply that the
hash values for two non-matching strings must be different: hash
"collisions," in which two strings do not match but happen to have the
same hash value, are specifically allowed.

<li>A highly desirable property of the hash function is that it runs
quickly.  The point of the hash is to reduce the amount of work needed
to look up a word by very quickly picking only one bin to look in.  If
the hash function takes a long time to compute, then the speed
advantage of this approach is reduced.

<li>Another highly desirable property is that the hash values for the
set of all words in the dictionary should distribute uniformly.  This
is important because it will ensure that about an equal number of
words goes into each bin, so that we don't have many empty bins and a
few bins with all of the words; if the words were to clump into a few
bins, then we wouldn't get much advantage out of limiting the
searching to one bin per word looked up.  There's no sure way to
guarantee uniform hash distribution, especially given that the set of
words in a particular dictionary can't be predicted in most cases;
however, practice has shown that certain types of hash functions
generally work pretty well.  If you are writing your own comparator
object, you can find information on how to write a good hash function
in practically any textbook on computer algorithms.

</ul>

</div>

<p><span class="code">matchValues(<i>inputStr</i>, <i>dictStr</i>)</span>
<div class=fdef>

Match the input string <i>inputStr</i> to the dictionary string
<i>dictStr</i>.  Returns zero or <span class="code">nil</span> if the values do not match, or
any other value if they do match.  Because any non-zero and non-nil
value indicates a match, this routine is free to encode additional
information about the match in the return value; typically,
implementations use bit flags (a combination of binary values OR'd
together) for this purpose.

<p>Note the asymmetry of the argument: the first argument is always an
input string, which is a string to be matched (such as the string
argument to the findWord() method); the second is always a dictionary
string, which is a string already stored in the dictionary that is
being compared with the input word.  Some implementations might take
advantage of this distinction to permit certain types of
approximations in input strings; for example, an implementation might
allow an input string to be abbreviated to a leading substring of the
dictionary string, so that "flashl" matches "flashlight," but not vice
versa.

</div>

<h2>Compiler Support</h2>

<p>The TADS 3 compiler has built-in support for the Dictionary
intrinsic class.  (This built-in support is part of the compiler, not
the interpreter; as far as the interpreter is concerned, a Dictionary
object is the same as any other kind of object.)  The compiler support
is provided by the statements <span class="code">dictionary</span> and <span class="code">dictionary property</span>,
and by recognition of dictionary properties when defined in object
property lists.

<p>The <span class="code">dictionary</span> statement has two purposes.  First, it defines a
new object instance of class Dictionary, if the name has not been
previously defined.  Second, it establishes the active dictionary,
which is the dictionary into which the compiler will insert each
dictionary word defined with an object.

<p>The <span class="code">dictionary property</span> statement tells the compiler that a
given property is henceforth a "dictionary property."  This means
that, whenever the property is subsequently used in an object
definition, the property defines dictionary words for the object.  The
compiler then automatically enters the words into the active
dictionary under the given property.

<p>Here's some sample code that demonstrates how these statements work.

<p><div class="code"><pre>
// create a new dictionary and make it active
dictionary myDict;

// establish the dictionary properties
dictionary property noun, adjective, plural;

// define an object
redBook: Book
    noun = 'book' 'booklet'
    adjective = 'red'
;
</pre></div>

<p>Note that dictionary properties use a special "implied list"
syntax: there's no need to enclose a vocabulary property's string list
in square brackets.  In fact, the TADS 3 compiler doesn't even allow
list notation for dictionary properties - you <i>must</i> use the
implied list format.

<h2><a name="spellingCorrection">Spelling correction</a></h2>

<p>The Dictionary class provides support for spelling correction
through the <span class="code">correctSpelling()</span> method, which generates a list of
possible corrections for a misspelled word.  This method by itself
doesn't constitute a complete spelling corrector, but it makes it a
lot easier to write a spelling corrector, since it does a lot of the
heavy lifting.  Implementing a complete spelling corrector is beyond
the scope of the Dictionary class, since a full corrector would
normally use application-specific context information to rank the
possible dictionary matches to a misspelled word.  For example, to
correct spelling in an IF game's command line input, a corrector could
analyze the grammatical context of the misspelled word in the overall
command line, as well as the current state of the world model (such as
the list of nearby objects).  That sort of context information is
outside of the the Dictionary class's domain.

<p>You might wonder, then, why the Dictionary class would involve
itself in spelling correction at all.  The equivalent functionality of
<span class="code">correctSpelling()</span> could be implemented separately from the
Dictionary class, and in fact extension libraries that do this are
already available.  If the rest of the spelling corrector has to be
implemented externally, why not this part as well?  The reason is
efficiency.  Generating a list of candidate words is one of the key
performance bottlenecks in spelling correction, and there's a special
advantage to integrating this process with the Dictionary data.  This
isn't just the obvious advantage of a native code version, although
that's also an important factor for such a compute-intensive task.
The bigger advantage is a particularly fast algorithm that's only
possible with direct access to the Dictionary data.

<p>For the technically inclined, here are some details.  Most spelling
correctors are based on an "edit distance" formula, usually the
Levenshtein distance.  A corrector must take a misspelled input word
and produce a set of candidate corrections based on the edit distance
formula.  The fastest algorithms for producing candidate sets based on
the Levenshtein distance use state-machine automata.  TADS uses a
relatively new algorithm that's particular efficient.  It involves a
special dual automaton that simultaneously traverses a Levenshtein
state machine and a dictionary "trie", which is state machine
version of the dictionary data.  The algorithm's efficiency
comes from the integration of the two state machines, which allows the
automaton to avoid blind alleys that a regular Levenshtein automaton
has to traverse.  The dual automaton immediately detects dead ends in
the Levensthein paths because it considers the dictionary data at
every step.  This greatly reduces the search space and thus the
execution time.  It would be possible to build the same algorithm
externally by maintaining a side copy of the dictionary's contents,
but that would require some way to keep the copy synchronized with the
main dictionary.  It's simpler to build the algorithm within the
dictionary so that everything stays in sync naturally.


<h2>Dictionary methods</h2>

<p><span class="code">addWord(<i>obj</i>, <i>str</i>, <i>vocabProp</i>)</span>
<div class=fdef>

Add an object to the dictionary with the given string and property
key.  <i>str</i> can be a string value, or can be a list (or Vector or
other <a href="opoverload.htm#listlike">list-like object</a>)
containing strings.  If <i>str</i> is a list of strings, the result is
the same as calling <span class="code">addWord()</span> once for each string in the list.
If the word association to be added is already defined (i.e., another
entry with the same string, object, and property already exists), the
new association is simply ignored.  <i>obj</i> is the object to
associate with the given vocabulary word or words, and
<i>vocabProp</i> is the dictionary property ID (<span class="code">&amp;noun</span>,
<span class="code">&amp;adjective</span>, etc) to use for the association.

</div>

<p><span class="code">correctSpelling(<i>str</i>, <i>maxEditDistance</i>)</span>
<div class=fdef>

Returns a list of words in the dictionary that are possible spelling
corrections for the given string <i>str</i>.  The returned list
contains each word defined in the dictionary whose edit distance from
<i>str</i> is less than or equal to <i>maxEditDistance</i>.

<p><i>maxEditDistance</i> is an integer giving the maximum edit distance
to include in the results.

<p>The edit distance between two words is defined as the smallest
number of single-character insertions, deletions, replacements, and
transpositions necessary to transform one word into another.  This is
often called the "Levenshtein distance", but note that our version
isn't strictly a Levenshtein distance because we count transposition
as one step.  (A transposition is a reversal of the positions of two
adjacent letters, such as changing "edti" to "edit" by switching the
"ti" to "it".  The strict definition of the Levenshtein distance
doesn't include transpositions, so a transposition counts as two steps
- an insertion plus a deletion - in an actual Levenshtein distance.)

<p>The concept of edit distance and its use in spelling correction are
well documented on the Web, so we won't go into a lot more detail
here.  For more information, a good starting point is the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance">Wikipedia
article</a>.

<p>The return value is a list with all of the words in the dictionary
that match <i>str</i> within the specified maximum edit distance.  Any
given dictionary word will appear only once in the returned list.
The list is in arbitrary order.  Each element of the list is a sublist,
[<i>word</i>, <i>dist</i>, <i>repl</i>]:

<ul class=doublespace>

   <li><i>word</i> is a string giving the matching dictionary word.

   <li><i>dist</i> is an integer giving the actual edit distance
   between <i>word</i> and the search string <i>str</i>; this ranges
   from 0 for an exact match up to the maximum edit distance you
   requested.

   <li><i>repl</i> is the number of character replacements that must
   be performed to transform <i>str</i> into <i>word</i>.  The
   edit distance <i>dist</i> includes this figure, since a single-character
   replacement is one of the edit operations counted in the distance.
   <i>repl</i> is called out separately because some spelling correctors
   consider a replacement to be a heavier change than other edits, and
   use replacements to break ties.  For example, consider "book" and
   "box" as corrections for "bok": both have edit distance 1, but some
   correctors might choose "book" over "box" as the correction because
   "book" can be corrected by inserting an "o", while "box" requires
   replacing the "k" with an "x".

</ul>

<p>If the Dictionary has a StringComparator object as its current
comparator, the results will take into account its case folding
setting, truncation length, and character mappings.  These
"approximations" are <b>not</b> considered to be edits, so they don't
count against the maximum edit distance.  Note an important
limitation, though: custom comparators that aren't of the
StringComparator class are ignored.  If you use your own object type
(not a StringComparator object) as the comparator, this method will
only find matches based on the exact text of the dictionary words.
This limitation is necessary because the custom comparator interface
doesn't provide enough information for the spelling corrector to
figure inexact matches of other kinds.

<p>How do you choose a maximum edit distance?  Unfortunately, there's
no theoretically perfect choice.  Other factors in the overall design
of a spelling corrector will affect the choice, so the best approach
is to experiment with different distances to find the best one for
your specific implementation.  The basic trade-off is that if you pick
a value that's too low, you won't find as many possible matches, so
the match that the user actually intended might be missed; but if you
pick a value that's too high, you'll get lots of false positives,
and it'll be hard to find the right match among all the chaff.
Higher distances also make the search take longer, for
obvious reasons.

<p>The literature on spelling correction suggests that 2 is a pretty
good all-purpose limit for edit distance in almost any application.
However, you'll probably do even better by varying this slightly
according to the word length.  Our own empirical testing suggests a
roughly logarithmic scale works best: edit distance 1 for short words
(four letters or fewer), 2 for medium words (up to seven letters), and
3 for longer words.  Apart from empirical experience, there are some
intuitive reasons for using these numbers.  For very short words
(three or four letters), two edits seems to be too many simply because
it's possible to transform any short word into almost any other short
word in two edits.  For long words, the chances of multiple typos
increase, and the chances of false matches thin out considerably, so
it seems worthwhile to increase the distance limit for these words.


</div>

<p><span class="code">findWord(<i>str</i>, <i>vocabProp</i>?)</span>
<div class=fdef>

Search the dictionary for the given string and property ID.  Returns a
list giving all of the matching objects; if there are no objects,
returns an empty list.  If <i>vocabProp</i> is omitted or is <span class="code">nil</span>,
the method returns all of the objects that match the string with
<i>any</i> property.

<p>The returned list consists of two elements for each matching
object.  The first element of each pair is the matching object; the
second element is the return value from the current comparator's
<span class="code">matchValues()</span> method for the match.  For example, suppose that the
comparator simply returns <span class="code">nil</span> for no match or <span class="code">true</span> for a
match; the result list might then look like this:

<p><div class="code"><pre>
[blueBook, true, booklet, true, matchbook, true]
</pre></div>

<p>The <span class="code">matchValues()</span> result is included because some comparators
use the result to supply additional information about the match.  For
example, StringComparator encodes information on case folding,
truncation, and equivalence mappings.  The caller could use this
information to choose some matches over others, for example.

</div>

<p><span class="code">forEachWord(<i>func</i>)</span>
<div class=fdef>

Invokes the callback function <i>func</i> on each word association in
the dictionary.  <i>func</i> is invoked as <span class="code">(<i>func</i>)(<i>obj</i>, <i>str</i>, <i>vocabProp</i>)</span>,
where <i>obj</i>, <i>str</i>, and <i>vocabProp</i> have
the same meanings they do in <span class="code">addWord()</span>.  Note that a given string
can appear many times in a dictionary, so <i>func</i> can be invoked
with the same <i>str</i> value multiple times, once for each
string/object/property association.

</div>

<p><span class="code">isWordDefined(<i>str</i>)</span>
<div class=fdef>

Searches the dictionary for the given string and determines if it's
associated with any objects.  If the word occurs in the dictionary at
all, this function returns <span class="code">true</span>; otherwise, it returns <span class="code">nil</span>.

</div>

<p><span class="code">removeWord(<i>obj</i>, <i>str</i>, <i>vocabProp</i>)</span>
<div class=fdef>

Removes from the dictionary the object's association with the given
string and property ID key.  Only the specific association of object,
string, and property is removed; if the same object is also associated
with other strings, the object is not removed from those other
associations, and likewise if the same string and property are
associated with different objects, those object associations are not
removed.  <i>str</i> can be a string value, or it can be a list (or
Vector or other <a href="opoverload.htm#listlike">list-like
object</a>) containing strings.  If it's a list of strings, the result
is the same as calling <span class="code">removeWord()</span> separately for each string in
the list.  If the word association to be removed is not defined, the
operation is simply ignored.

</div>

<p><span class="code">setComparator(<i>compObj</i>)</span>
<div class=fdef>

<p>Set the comparator object.  All subsequent dictionary operations
are performed with the new comparator object.  If <i>compObj</i> is
<span class="code">nil</span>, the dictionary simply matches input strings to dictionary strings
exactly.

<p>Once installed, the dictionary considers a comparator object to be
immutable.  That is, the dictionary assumes that the return values
from the required methods of the comparator for a given set of inputs
will never change.  If you want to change the comparison rules for a
dictionary, you must create and install a new comparator object: never
attempt to change the comparison rules by modifying an existing
comparator.

<p>Note that changing the comparator is a relatively expensive
operation, because the dictionary must rebuild its internal table for
the new comparator; programs should thus avoid changing comparators
except when necessary.

</div>

<h2>Notes</h2>

<p>There are a few other important things to know about dictionaries.

<p><b>Dictionaries and garbage collection:</b> A dictionary references
its objects "weakly."  This means that adding an object to a
dictionary does not prevent the garbage collector from deleting the
object.  If an object is referenced in a dictionary, but the object
becomes otherwise unreachable, the garbage collector will delete the
object, and will at the same time remove all of the object's
associations from the dictionary.  While this might seem strange at
first glance, it is actually very useful, because it means that you
don't have to worry about manually deleting dictionary references to
objects that have become unneeded.

<p>Because dictionaries reference their entries weakly, the mere
presence of an object in a dictionary never keeps the garbage
collector from deleting the object.  Hence, if an object in a
dictionary becomes otherwise unreachable, the collector will
eventually delete the object.  This is normally desirable, because
dictionaries are usually used only as a performance optimization to
make it quicker to find an object given its name.  However, it is
sometimes the case that a dictionary is the primary way to access a
group of objects; in these cases, the weak references that a
dictionary uses are undesirable because they don't prevent your
objects from being deleted.  In these cases, you must create some
other explicit reference to your objects; an easy way to accomplish
this is to add each such object to a list stored in a property of a
static object.  You must take care to remove these explicit references
when their objects are no longer needed, so that the objects can be
deleted.

<p><b>Creating dictionaries dynamically:</b> You can create a
dictionary object at run-time using the <span class="code">new</span> operator.  Note that,
when doing this, you should be sure to <span class="code">#include &lt;dict.h&gt;</span> in your
source file to ensure that the compiler knows about the Dictionary
class.

<p><div class="code"><pre>
// include the system header defining the Dictionary class
#include &lt;dict.h&gt;

myFunc()
{
  // create a new dictionary (with the default
  // string comparator)
  local dict = new Dictionary();

  // add some words
  dict.addWord(redBook, 'red', &amp;adjective);
  dict.addWord(redBook, 'book', &amp;noun);
}
</pre></div>

<p><b>Using multiple dictionaries in the compiler:</b> You can use
multiple dictionaries at compile-time simply by using a new
<span class="code">dictionary</span> statement for each dictionary.  You can switch back to
an existing dictionary with another <span class="code">dictionary</span> statement naming the
original dictionary.  The <span class="code">dictionary</span> statement establishes the active
dictionary, which remains in effect until the next <span class="code">dictionary</span>
statement.  Multiple dictionaries might be useful in certain
situations, such as when you want to create different parsing modes,
each having their own separate vocabulary words.

<p><b>Dynamic object creation and dictionaries:</b> When you create a
new simulation object with operator <span class="code">new</span>, the interpreter will
<b>not</b> automatically add any vocabulary to any dictionary for the
object.  While this might seem a deficiency, remember that the
interpreter doesn't think of Dictionary objects as anything special,
so it doesn't have any idea that you might want some random object
creation to have a side effect on a completely unrelated object (such
as a Dictionary).

<p>If you're using the adv3 library, you won't notice this lack of
automatic action on the part of the interpreter, because the adv3
library <i>does</i> provide automatic vocabulary handling for new
objects, via constructors in the basic simulation-object classes.

<p>If you're defining your own library, you'll probably want to put
something like this in the constructors for your simulation
object base classes:

<p><div class="code"><pre>
class Thing: object
  construct()
  {
    // add all of my vocabulary to the default dictionary
    libDict.addWord(self, noun, &amp;noun);
    libDict.addWord(self, adjective, &amp;adjective);
    libDict.addWord(self, plural, &amp;plural);
  }
;
</pre></div>

<p>As long as each class derived from Thing (or from subclasses of
Thing) properly inherits its superclass constructor from its own
constructor, the library code will take care of adding the vocabulary
words for the new instance, taking advantage of the accessibility of
the dictionary property values that TADS 3 provides.

<p><b>Dictionary vs. LookupTable:</b> The Dictionary class is in some
ways similar to the LookupTable intrinsic class, in that both objects
allow you to associate keys with values and efficiently look up a
value by key.  However, Dictionary is considerably more specialized
than the general-purpose LookupTable: Dictionary allows multiple
values to be associated with a key, and provides the composite
property/string key.  Dictionary is also designed specifically to
store its specialized data, and makes more efficient use of memory
than a more general implementation would.  In addition, Dictionary
allows the string comparison rules to be customized through the
comparator object.

<h2>Notes for TADS 2 users</h2>

<p>The TADS 2 functions for manipulating the parser dictionary don't
exist in TADS 3.  The equivalent functionality is implemented through
methods on the Dictionary object.

<p>Even though code that defines vocabulary words for an object looks
similar to the way it did in TADS 2, though, there are some important
differences:

<ul class=doublespace>

<li>First, the <span class="code">noun</span> and <span class="code">adjective</span> properties behave at run-time
like ordinary properties: the compiler sets the values of these
properties to simple string lists containing the strings actually
defined, plus any strings inherited from superclasses.  You can use
and modify these properties during program execution just like any
other, but since they're nothing special to the interpreter, changing
them has no effect on the dictionary.  Updating the dictionary requires
explicitly using Dictionary methods (<span class="code">addWord()</span>, etc).

<li>Second, the Dictionary object created by the <span class="code">dictionary</span>
statement is a full-fledged object at run-time.  This means that you
can call Dictionary methods on this object in your program, to look up
words and modify the dictionary dynamically.  There was no equivalent
object in TADS 2.
