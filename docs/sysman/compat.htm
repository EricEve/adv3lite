<p>If you're experiencing a problem with HTML TADS or TADS Workbench,
please consult the notes below.  We've found a few situations where
different Windows system configurations can cause problems.  The notes
below explain how to fix the configuration problems we know about.

<p>If you can't find a solution to your problem here, you might try
checking the Usenet newsgroup <a
href='news:rec.arts.int-fiction'>rec.arts.int-fiction</a> to see if
anyone else has run into the same problem, or you can go to <a
href='http://www.tads.org'>tads.org</a> for information on how to

Workbench on Windows 95/98: "SHELL32.DLL:SHGetFolderPathA" Error
</div>

<div class=content>

<p>If you're running TADS Workbench on Windows 95 or 98, launching
Workbench might show the following error messages:

<p>

<div class=indented>
<pre>
Error Starting Program
The HTMLDB3.EXE file is linked to missing export SHELL32.DLL:SHGetFolderPathA.
</pre>
</div>

<p>If you get this error, you should be able to fix it by installing
Microsoft Internet Explorer version 5 or later.  The issue is that
Workbench depends upon a newer version of a certain Windows system DLL
than what comes with 95 and 98 by default.  IE 5 and later
automatically upgrade this DLL as part of their installation process,
so updating the DLL is simply a matter of updating IE.

Crash running HTML TADS
</div>

<div class=content>

<p>If HTML TADS crashes, particularly when you select the "Options"
item of the "Edit" menu or "Customize" on the "Themes" menu, you
probably have an out-of-date version of a Windows system file called
COMCTL32.DLL.  If you encounter this problem, you can fix it by
downloading this file from the Microsoft web site:

<p>
<div class=indented>
<a href='ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/softlib/mslfiles/com32upd.exe'>
ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/softlib/mslfiles/com32upd.exe</a>
</div>

<p> After downloading the file, double-click it to run the
installation program, which will install the upgraded DLL for you.
Note that HTML TADS automatically checks to make sure you have the
correct version installed and warns you at startup if you don't.
Although you can choose to continue running if TADS displays this
warning, we strongly encourage you to upgrade your COMCTL32.DLL
before running HTML TADS.

Crash using Wine (Windows emulator for Linux)
</div>

<div class=content>

<p>If you're running HTML TADS in the Wine environment (a Windows
emulation environment for Linux/Unix systems), you might need to use the
"-noalphablend" command-line option when running htmltads.exe.
Some versions of Wine have a bug that causes the program to crash
immediately after startup.  This has been reported in particular
on the version known as WineX.  If you're running on Wine, and the
interpreter crashes immediately when you run it, try running it
from the command line like this:

<p><div class=indented>
<pre>
htmltads -noalphablend
</pre>
</div>

</div>

Western European characters on localized (Non-English) Windows systems
</div>

<div class=content>

<p>If you're running a Windows system that uses a character set
other than US/Western Europe (such as Windows Eastern European or
Cyrillic), please read this note.

<p>If you have any problems with HTML TADS displaying characters that
are <b>supposed</b> to be from the US/Western Europe character set,
but are instead displayed as characters from your system's default
character set, you might need to adjust your system configuration to
remove "font substitutions."  Many non-US/Western Europe systems use
font substitutions as a way to work around older applications that
don't have proper localized character set support, but the
substitutions can interfere with applications like HTML TADS that
do properly support localized character sets.

<p>To check for font substitutions, look at your WIN.INI file (usually
in your C:\WINDOWS directory).  Look for a line that starts with
"[fontsubstitutes]", then look for lines like this:

<p>
<div class=indented>
<pre>
Arial,0=Arial,238
</pre>
</div>

<p>(The second number might be something other than 238.)  If you find
any lines like this, you might want to try deleting them or commenting
them out (by putting a semicolon, ";", at the start of each line).
You might need to reboot your system before your changes take effect.

<p><b>Windows NT users:</b> On NT, the font substitutions are
specified in the registry rather than in WIN.INI.  Run REGEDIT and
look for a registry key with this path:

<p>
<div class=indented>
<pre>
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\FontSubstitutes
</pre>
</div>
<p>

</div>
</div>
