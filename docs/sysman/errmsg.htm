<h1>VM Run-Time Error Codes</h1>

<p>When the VM encounters an error in the user program, it throws an
exception of class RuntimeError.  This exception object always
contains an integer value its <span class="code">errno_</span> property giving the VM error
code for the error condition.  Programs that need to apply special
handling for certain types of errors can determine the specific
VM error condition via the error code <span class="code">errno_</span>.

<div class=errvb>
Unavailable intrinsic function called (the function is at index <i>nnn</i> in function set "<i>xxx</i>").  This function is not available in this version of the interpreter and cannot be called when running the program with this version.  This normally indicates either (a) that the "preinit" function (or code invoked by preinit) called an intrinsic that isn't available during this phase, such as an advanced display function; or (b) that the program used '&' to refer to a function address, andthe function isn't available in this interpreter version.
</div>

Invalid instruction opcode - the image file might be corrupted.
</div>

<p><span class=errid>2302: unhandled exception</span>
<div class=errvb>
An exception was thrown but was not caught by the program.  The interpreter is terminating execution of the program.
</div>

<p><span class=errid>2303: stack overflow</span>
<div class=errvb>
Stack overflow.  This indicates that function or method calls were nested too deeply; this might have occurred because of unterminated recursion, which can happen when a function or method calls itself (either directly or indirectly).
</div>

<p><span class=errid>2304: invalid type for intrinsic function argument</span>
<div class=errvb>
An invalid datatype was provided for an intrinsic function argument.
</div>

<p><span class=errid>2305: default output function is not defined</span>
<div class=errvb>
The default output function is not defined.  Implicit string display is not allowed until a default output function is specified.
</div>

<p><span class=errid>2306: invalid value for intrinsic function argument</span>
<div class=errvb>
An invalid value was specified for an intrinsic function argument.  The value is out of range or is not an allowed value.
</div>

<p><span class=errid>2307: breakpoint encountered</span>
<div class=errvb>
A breakpoint instruction was encountered, and no debugger is active.  The compiler might have inserted this breakpoint to indicate an invalid or unreachable location in the code, so executing this instruction probably indicates an error in the program.
</div>

<p><span class=errid>2308: external function calls are not implemented in this version</span>
<div class=errvb>
This version of the interpreter does not implement external function calls.  This program requires an interpreter that provides external function call capabilities, so this program is not compatible with this interpreter.
</div>

<p><span class=errid>2309: invalid opcode modifier - possible image file corruption</span>
<div class=errvb>
Invalid instruction opcode modifier - the image file might be corrupted.
</div>

<p><span class=errid>2310: No mapping file available for local character set "<i>xxx</i>"</span>
<div class=errvb>
[Warning: no mapping file is available for the local character set "<i>xxx</i>".  The system will use a default ASCII character set mapping instead, so accented characters will be displayed without their accents.]
</div>

<p><span class=errid>2311: Unhandled exception: <i>xxx</i></span>
<div class=errvb>
Unhandled exception: <i>xxx</i>
</div>

<p><span class=errid>2312: VM Error: <i>xxx</i></span>
<div class=errvb>
VM Error: <i>xxx</i>
<p>(This is used as a generic template for VM run-time exception messages.  The interpreter uses this to display unhandled exceptions that terminate the program.)
</div>

<p><span class=errid>2313: VM Error: code <i>nnn</i></span>
<div class=errvb>
VM Error: code <i>nnn</i>
<p>(This is used as a generic template for VM run-time exceptions.  The interpreter uses this to report unhandled exceptions that terminate the program.  When it can't find any message for the VM error code, the interpreter simply displays the error number using this template.)
</div>

<p><span class=errid>2314: Exception in static initializer for <i>xxx</i>.<i>xxx</i>: <i>xxx</i></span>
<div class=errvb>
An exception occurred in the static initializer for <i>xxx</i>.<i>xxx</i>: <i>xxx</i>
</div>

<p><span class=errid>2315: intrinsic class exception: <i>xxx</i></span>
<div class=errvb>
Exception in intrinsic class method: <i>xxx</i>
</div>

<p><span class=errid>2316: stack access is out of bounds</span>
<div class=errvb>
The program attempted to access a stack location that isn't part of the current expression storage area.  This probably indicates a problem with the compiler that was used to create this program, or a corrupted program file.
</div>

<p><span class=errid>2391: 'abort' signal</span>
<div class=errvb>
'abort' signal
<p>(This exception is used internally by the debugger to signal program termination via the debugger UI.)
</div>

<p><span class=errid>2392: 'restart' signal</span>
<div class=errvb>
'restart' signal
<p>(This exception is used internally by the debugger to signal program restart via the debugger UI.)
</div>

<p><span class=errid>2394: debugger VM halt</span>
<div class=errvb>
debugger VM halt
<p>(This exception is used internally by the debugger to signal program termination via the debugger UI.)
</div>

<p><span class=errid>2395: interrupted by user</span>
<div class=errvb>
The program was interrupted by a user interrupt key or other action.
</div>

<p><span class=errid>2396: no debugger available</span>
<div class=errvb>
An instruction was encountered that requires the debugger, but this interpreter version doesn't include debugging capaabilities.
</div>

<p><span class=errid>2500: invalid frame in debugger local/parameter evaluation</span>
<div class=errvb>
An invalid stack frame was specified in a debugger local/parameter evaluation.  This probably indicates an internal problem in the debugger.
</div>

<p><span class=errid>2501: invalid speculative expression</span>
<div class=errvb>
This expression cannot be executed speculatively.  (This does not indicate a problem; it's merely an internal condition in the debugger.)
</div>

<p><span class=errid>2502: invalid debugger expression</span>
<div class=errvb>
This expression cannot be evaluated in the debugger.
</div>

<p><span class=errid>2503: image file has no debugging information - recompile for debugging</span>
<div class=errvb>
The image file has no debugging information.  You must recompile the source code for this program with debugging information in order to run the program under the debugger.
</div>

<p><span class=errid>2600: out of temporary floating point registers (calculation too complex)</span>
<div class=errvb>
The interpreter is out of temporary floating point registers.  This probably indicates that an excessively complex calculation has been attempted.
</div>

<p><span class=errid>2601: cannot convert value to BigNumber</span>
<div class=errvb>
This value cannot be converted to a BigNumber.
</div>
