# ADV3LITE
## What is adv3Lite?
Adv3Lite is an alternative library for use with with the [TADS 3](https://www.tads.org) Interactive Fiction authoring system.
The _library_ is the part of the system that provides the parser (the bit that interprets and executes player commands) and the world model, as opposed to the TADS 3 _language_, which provides a substantial set of intrinsic functions in addition to the set of constructs normally found in a computer language.

Adv3Lite aims to provide a library that's easier to use than the adv3 library which comes standard with TADS 3, but which is almost as powerful and expressive. Adv3Lite misses out the bits that most games don't really need (like postures, room parts, and multiple light levels) while adding in some other bits that are often more useful (like scenes and regions, "borrowed" from Inform 7). Adv3Lite also cuts down drastically on the complexity of the adv3 class hierarchy (there are lots of classes to learn about in adv3!) while maintaining much of their functionality.

One area adv3Lite absolutely doesn't skimp on is the conversation system, which does everything the adv3 one can and more. At the basic level it's very similar to adv3's, but for more advanced conversational work it's more flexible and can do quite a few things that adv3's can't.

In sum, adv3Lite is an alternative library that's easier to learn and easier to use that adv3, but doesn't compromise on the functionality most commonly needed to write interactive fiction. It exists entirely in source form (written in TADS 3, a C-like language designed for writing Interactive Fiction) for use by game authors.

## What is in this repository?
This GitHub repository contains all the source files (.t, .tl and .h) files that make up the adv3Lite library along with most of the documentation files (a mix of htm and pdf files, which are located under the docs directory) which explain how to use adv3Lite. It does not yet, however, contain the _adv3 Library Reference Manual_ on account of its large size (the _adv3 Library Reference Manual_ is generated from the adveLite source files by a program called docgen, which also has a GitHub repository on this site). 

The adv3Lite library files contained in this repository are those at the current state of development, which are likely to be ahead of the current release version. The current release version, version 1.5, can be found in a zip file [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/t7jjkzua3ayxk40/adv3Lite15.zip?dl=0). A beta version of the upcoming v. 1.6 release can be found [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/n9qceshjocgjfxw/adv3Lite16beta.zip?dl=0). Both contain the complete _Library Reference Manual_ alomg with all the other adv3Lite documentation.

## How is adv3Lite used?
It would normally be installed under the extensions directory of your TADS 3 user files. Instructions for using it in a TADS 3 project are provided in the adv3Lite documentation.
