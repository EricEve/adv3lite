<h1>Ask, Tell, Give, Show</h1>

<h2>Introduction and Overview</h2>

<p>At its simplest, adv3Lite implements a basic ask/tell conversation system. This is so-called because it allows NPCs to respond to conversational commands of the form ASK BOB ABOUT LIGHTHOUSE or TELL MARTHA ABOUT BOB, as well as ASK BOB BOB FOR MONEY or GIVE THE COIN TO BOB or SHOW THE TICKET TO THE FLIGHT ATTENDANT.</p>

<p>In adv3Lite, the responses to commands of this sort can be defined using TopicEntries, just like the ConsultTopics we used when construction the computer in the <a href="security.htm#consult">Security Centre</a>. There are various kinds of TopicEntry corresponding to the various kinds of conversational commands we have just listed:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>AskTopic</strong> responds to ASK X ABOUT Y</li>
<li><strong>TellTopic</strong> responds to TELL X ABOUT Y</li>
<li><strong>AskTellTopic</strong> responds to ASK X ABOUT Y or TELL X ABOUT Y</li>
<li><strong>AskForTopic</strong> responds to ASK X FOR Y</li>
<li><strong>GiveTopic</strong> responds to GIVE Y TO X (or equivalently, GIVE X Y, e.g. GIVE BOB THE COIN)</li>
<li><strong>ShowTopic</strong> responds to SHOW Y TO X (or equivalently, SHOW X Y, e.g. SHOW BOB THE COIN)</li>
<li><strong>GiveShowTopic</strong> responds to GIVE Y TO X or SHOW Y TO X</li>
</ul>

<p>In all the above, X is the person being addressed. For Give or Show Y must be a physical game object in scope that is to be given or shown to X. For all the rest Y is a topic, which may be any game object the player character knows about or any abstract topic defined in the game, like the <span class="code">tFrenchRevolution</span> and <span class="code">tFlightDepartures</span> topics we defined for the security centre <a href="security.htm#consult">computer</a>.</p>

<p>Note also that once a conversation with a particular NPC is underway, the player can enter abbreviated forms of all the above commands without having to name the NPC again, such as ASK ABOUT Y or just A Y, T Y (for TELL X ABOUT Y), ASK FOR Y, SHOW Y and GIVE Y. These abbreviated conversational commands still trigger the same kinds of TopicEntry.</p>

<p>To associate a conversational TopicEntry with a particular NPC we can put it in one of two places: either directly located within the NPC (generally using the + syntax to indicate its location), or located within one of the NPC's ActorStates. Any TopicEntries placed in an ActorState will only be triggered while the NPC is in that state; this enables us to customize an NPC's responses according to the state it's in, if we so wish. TopicEntries in an Actor's current state take precedence over any defined directly in the Actor (if they would match the same topic/object), but TopicEntries placed directly in the Actor can be used to provide responses that are independent of ActorState (or, or course, for NPCs that don't have different states). This should all become clearer once we start working through some examples.</p>

<p>Obviously we can't anticipate every conversational command a player might try. There may be reasonable ones we miss, like ASK ATTENDANT ABOUT REFRESHMENTS or unreasonable ones like ASK ATTENDANT ABOUT HER MOTHER'S LAST HOLIDAY, but either way we need our NPCs to be able to respond in a way that effectively tells the player "I am not programmed to respond in this area" while sounding a bit more believably human. For this purpose we can define one or more catch-all DefaultTopics, that will provide a response to something we hadn't specifically allowed for. The principal kinds of DefaultTopic commonly used are:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>DefaultAskTopic</strong> responds to ASK X ABOUT Y</li>
<li><strong>DefaultTellTopic</strong> responds to TELL X ABOUT Y</li>
<li><strong>DefaultAskTellTopic</strong> responds to ASK X ABOUT Y or TELL X ABOUT Y</li>
<li><strong>DefaultAskForTopic</strong> responds to ASK X FOR Y</li>
<li><strong>DefaultGiveTopic</strong> responds to GIVE Y TO X (or equivalently, GIVE X Y, e.g. GIVE BOB THE COIN)</li>
<li><strong>DefaultShowTopic</strong> responds to SHOW Y TO X (or equivalently, SHOW X Y, e.g. SHOW BOB THE COIN)</li>
<li><strong>DefaultGiveShowTopic</strong> responds to GIVE Y TO X or SHOW Y TO X</li>
<li><strong>DefaultAnyTopic</strong> responds to any conversational command for which we have not provided a more specific response.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that there is an order of precedence among DefaultTopics, the more specific taking precedence over the less specific. Thus, for example, if you define a DefaultAnyTopic, a DefaultAskTellTopic, and a DefaultAskTopic for the same actor, the DefaultAskTopic will respond to ASK X ABOUT Y, the DefaultAskTellTopic will respond to TELL X ABOUT Y, and the DefaultAnyTopic to anything else (such as ASK X FOR Y or HSOY Y TO X).</p>

<p>The above list of TopicEntry and DefaultTopic types is not exhaustive. For the complete list consult the <a href="../manual/actortopicentry.htm#types">ActorTopicEntry</a> section of the <em>adv3Lite Library Manual</em>. But the list shown above is sufficient for now; we'll come to some of the other types in later sections when we discuss various ways in which adv3Lite can go beyond the basic ask/tell system. For the remainder of this section we'll illustrate some examples of basic ask/tell by making some of the characters in our airport a bit more talkative.</p>
<br>

<h2>Not Talking to Pablo Cortez</h2>

<p>We don't actually want our protagonist to talk to Pablo Cortez at all, since the idea is to avoid attracting Cortez's attention. In this case all we need is a single DefaultAnyTopic that explains this:</p>

<p><div class="code"><pre>
+ DefaultAnyTopic
    "You really don't want to attract his attention. If he recognizes you he'll
    kill you. "
    
    isConversational = nil
;
</pre></div>

<p>This object definition should be placed somewhere after the <span class="code">cortez</span> object in the npcs.t file so that the + sign locates it in cortez.</p>

<p>We define <span class="code">isConversational = nil</span> on this DefaultAnyTopic because no conversation actually takes place (and so we don't want Cortez marked as the player character's current interlocutor).</p>

<p>And that's really all we have to do to complete our implementation of Pablo Cortez.</p>
<br>

<h2>Limited Conversation with the Security Guard</h2>

<p>The Security Guard is not a major NPC in our game, but there are one or two things the player character could reasonably try to talk with him about. One obvious topic of conversation, since the player character is anxious to find a plane leaving the airport, would be flight departures, for which we've already defined a corresponding <span class="code">tFlightDepartures</span> Topic object. As a first attempt, then, we might define an AskTopic for our Security Guard thus:</p>

 <p><div class="code"><pre>
+ AskTopic @tFlightDepartures
   "&lt;q&gt;When's the next plane out of here?&lt;/q&gt; you ask.\b
   &lt;q&gt;Listen for the announcements, Se&amp;ntilde;or,&lt;/q&gt; he suggests, &lt;q&gt;or look at
   the departure boards through there.&lt;/q&gt; He jerks his thumb vaguely in the
   direction of north. &quot;
;</pre></div>

<p>Here we use the @ symbol in the TopicEntry template to denote the fact that we're defining the AskTopic's <span class="code">matchObj</span> property, namely the Topic (or Thing) that we want this AskTopic to match. We have also use the &amp;ntilde; HTML entity to provide the &ntilde; in Se&ntilde;or.</p>

<p>This AskTopic will do the job well enough, but it will make the security guard seem a bit robotic, since he'll give precisely the same answer every time the player character asks him about flight departures. We can alleviate this a little by using a StopEventList on the AskTopic to vary the response. A StopEventList runs through each item in its list in turn and then keeps repeating the last. To use one with a TopicEntry we simply add StopEventList to the class list and then supply a list of single-quoted strings in place of the double-quoted string giving the response:</p>

 <p><div class="code"><pre>
+ AskTopic, StopEventList @tFlightDepartures
    [
        '&lt;q&gt;When\'s the next plane out of here?&lt;/q&gt; you ask.\b
        &lt;q&gt;Listen for the announcements, Se&amp;ntilde;or,&lt;/q&gt; he suggests, &lt;q&gt;or
        look at the departure boards through there.&lt;/q&gt; He jerks his thumb
        vaguely in the direction of north. ',
        
        '&lt;q&gt;Is there a flight leaving soon?&lt;/q&gt; you enquire.\b
        &lt;q&gt;I already told you, Se&amp;ntilde;or: listen for the announcements or
        watch the board,&lt;/q&gt; he replies with a faint air of impatience.'
    ]
;
</pre></div>

<p>Since this man is presumably meant to have someting to do with aiport securiy, it's possible that the player character might try to tell him about Pablo Cortez's takeover of the plane, which we can do in a similar fashion via a TellTopic:</p>

 <p><div class="code"><pre>
+ TellTopic, StopEventList @cortez
    [
        '&lt;q&gt;A criminal called Pablo Cortez has just tried to take over the
        flight to Buenos Aires,&lt;/q&gt; you say.\b
        &lt;q&gt;I am sure it will all be taken care of, Se&amp;ntilde;or,&lt;/q&gt; the guard
        assures you nonchalantly. ',
        
        '&lt;q&gt;Pablo Cortez...&lt;/q&gt; you begin.\b
        The guard cuts you off with a gesture of his hand. &lt;q&gt;All taken care
        of, Se&amp;ntilde;or,&lt;/q&gt; he insists. '
    ]
;
</pre></div>

<p>If you try compiling and running the game at this point, you'll find that this TellTopic won't be triggered unless and until the player character has actually seen Cortez, which is this case is what we want. But how does this come about? The answer is that a TopicEntry won't match a game object (like cortez) unless the player character knows about it, and unless we arrange things otherwise, the player character only comes so know about things when he's seen them. This wasn't an issue with the <span class="code">tFlightDepartures</span> topic, precisely because it's a Topic, and the library's default assumption is that all Topics start out known tot he player character. If we had wanted the player character to start out knowing about Cortez, we could have included <span class="code">familiar = true</span> on the definition of the <span class="code">cortez</span> object, or we could have called <span class="code">gSetKnown(cortez)</span> at some convenient point in the game; but here it suits us to treat Cortez as unknown until the player character sees him.</p>

<p>Something else the player character might obviously try to do in conversation with the security guard is to ask for the ID card back once it's been confiscated. Fpr that purpose we can use an AskForTopic:</p>

 <p><div class="code"><pre>
+ AskForTopic @IDcard
    "&lt;q&gt;Can I have my ID card back, please?&lt;/q&gt; you ask.\b
    &lt;q&gt;That was not your ID card, Se&amp;ntilde;or,&lt;/q&gt; the guard replies equably.
    &lt;q&gt;I know Antonio Velaquez, and you are not he.&lt;/q&gt; "
;
</pre></div>

<p>The problem is that this AskForTopic can be triggered once the player has seen the ID card; there's no guarantee that it will have been confiscated. We therefore need to place some kind of condition on when this AskForTopic is active. We can do that by defining its isActive property. The next question is what condition to place on it. When the ID card has been confiscated it's returned to its initial position on the counter, but that's not enough by itself, since if we just defined <span class="code">isActive = (IDCard.location == counter)</span>, the AskForTopic could be triggered if the player character had simply seen the card and left it in place. We need to know additionally that the Security Guard has actually confiscated the card.</p>

<p>We can do this by using a <span class="code">&lt;.reveal&gt;</span> tag in the message announcing the confiscation of the card, and then testing for the output of that tag with <span class="code">gRevealed()</span>. We can used <span class="code">&lt;.reveal <em>key</em>&gt;</span> whenever we want to represent the revelation of some fact to the player character. Here <em>key</em> is just an arbitrary piece of text we use to represent the fact in question. Here, for example, we could use <span class="code">card-confiscated</span>.</p>

<p>First, then, we must add a <span class="code">&lt;.reveal&gt;</span> tag to the notice of the card's confiscation; this occurs on the definition of the metal detector:</p>

 <p><div class="code"><pre>
+ metalDetector: Passage 'metal detector; crude; frame'
    "The metal detector is little more than a crude metal frame, just large
    enough to step through, with a power cable trailing across the floor. "
    destination = concourse
    
    isOn = (powerSwitch.isOn == true)
    
    canTravelerPass(traveler)
    {
        return !isOn || !IDcard.isIn(traveler);
    }
    
    explainTravelBarrier(traveler)
    {
        "The metal detector buzzes furiously as you pass through it. The
        security guard beckons you back immediately, with a pointed
        tap of his holstered pistol. After a brisk search, he discovers the ID
        card and takes it off you with a disapproving shake of his head,
        <strong>before handing it to a colleague who walks off with it. &lt;.reveal
        card-confiscated&gt; ";</strong>
        
        IDcard.moveInto(counter);
    }
    
    travelDesc()
    {
        "You pass through the metal detector without incident. ";
        
        if(takeover.startedAt == nil)
            announcementObj.start();
    }
;
</pre></div>
<p>At the same time as adding the <span class="code">&lt;.reveal card-confiscated&gt;</span> tag we've added a few words about a colleague to explain how the card finds is way back to the counter.</p>

<p>The next step is to add the appropriate isActive condition to the AskForTopic:</p>

 <p><div class="code"><pre>
+ AskForTopic @IDcard
    "&lt;q&gt;Can I have my ID card back, please?&lt;/q&gt; you ask.\b
    &lt;q&gt;That was not your ID card, Se&amp;ntilde;or,&lt;/q&gt; the guard replies equably.
    &lt;q&gt;I know Antonio Velaquez, and you are not he.&lt;/q&gt; "
    
   <strong> isActive = gRevealed('card-confiscated') &amp;&amp; IDcard.location == counter</strong>
;
</pre></div>

<p>This is not absolutely bullet-proof, since the player character could find the ID card on the counter after it has been confiscated and still leave it there, which would make his request to the guard at least a bit tongue-in-cheek, but it will probably do well enough.</p>

<p>One more thing the player might try is to show the card to the guard in the hope that this will somehow facilitate his passage through the metal detector. In that case the guard will presumably confiscate it, which means we'll need our ShowTopic to do a bit more than just display some text. We can do that by defining its topicResponse property explicitly as method rather than as a double-quoted string via the template:</p>

 <p><div class="code"><pre>
+ ShowTopic @IDcard
    topicResponse()
    {
        "You flash the ID card at the security guard, in the hope that it'll
        persuade him to let you straight through without any further questions,
        but instead he snatches it off you, stares at it with a deep frown.\b
        &lt;q&gt;This is not yours, Se&amp;ntilde;or,&lt;/q&gt; he remarks.\b
        So saying, he hands the card to a colleague who at once carries it off
        somewhere.&lt;.reveal card-confiscated&gt; ";
        
        IDcard.moveInto(counter);
    }    
;
</pre></div>

<p>Because of the way the ShowTo action is defined, a ShowTopic can't be triggered unless the object it's meant to match is visible, so there's no danger that this one will be matched while the card is still on the counter, say, but we might prefer it to be matched only if the player character is actually carrying the card. We could do that with as isActive condition on the ShowTopic, but a slightly neater solution is to put an objHeld preCondition on the ShowTo response of the IDcard, since this will trigger an implicit take if the player character drops the card before showing it to the guard:</p>

 <p><div class="code"><pre>
++ IDcard: Key 'an ID Card; identification poor; photo'     
    "According to what's on the front it apparently belongs to one Antonio
    Velaquez. Fortunately the accompanying photo is so poor it could be of
    almost anyone, even you. A magnetic stripe runs down the back. "
    
    actualLockList = [securityDoor]
    plausibleLockList = [securityDoor]
    
    bulk = 1
    
    <strong>dobjFor(ShowTo)   {  preCond = [objHeld]   }</strong>
;
</pre></div>

<p>Finally, we should give the security guard some form of default response to handle all other conversational commands. Since he's not really a major character we can afford to go with something fairly unsophisticated:</p>

 <p><div class="code"><pre>
+ DefaultAnyTopic
    "The guard merely shrugs and mutters something that could be either, &lt;q&gt;Not
    my concern, Se&amp;ntilde;or,&lt;/q&gt; or &lt;q&gt;Not your concern, Se&amp;ntilde;or.&lt;/q&gt; "
;
</pre></div>
<br>
<h2>Showing the Ticket to the Flight Attendant</h2>

<p>You'll recall that as a temporary expedient we put some code in the angelaTicketAgenda AgendaItem so that the flight attendant would automatically see if the player character was carrying a ticket, and allow him to board if so. Now we know how to allow the player character to show things to people, we can remove that code:</p>

 <p><div class="code"><pre>
+ angelaTicketAgenda: ConvAgendaItem
    initiallyActive = true
    
    invokeItem()
    {
        isDone = true;
        "&lt;q&gt;Welcome aboard, sir,&lt;/q&gt; {the subj angela} greets you with a smile.
        &lt;q&gt;May I see your ticket please?&lt;/q&gt; ";
           <span class="comment">       
//        /* The code shown commented out below can be deleted */
//        if(ticket.isDirectlyIn(me))
//        {
//            "She glances down at the ticket in your hand, and temporarily takes
//            it off you to check it. &lt;q&gt;That's fine, sir,&lt;/q&gt; she assures you as
//            she returns it to you. &lt;q&gt;Please move to the rear of the plane to
//            find a seat.&lt;/q&gt; ";
//            angelaGreetingState.ticketSeen = true;
//        }</span>        
    }
;
</pre></div>

<p>Instead, we can put similar code in the topicResponse() method of a GiveShowTopic, so that the player character can (and must) explicitly show his ticket to the flight attendant. Since this is only relevant when the flight attendant is in her <span class="code">angelaGreetingState</span> state, it's probably best to locate our GiveShowTopic there rather than directly in angela:</p>

 <p><div class="code"><pre>
++ GiveShowTopic @ticket
    topicResponse()
    {
        "&lt;q&gt;Here you are,&lt;/q&gt; you say, holding out the ticket for {the angela}
        to see.\b
        She glances down at the ticket in your hand, and temporarily takes it
        off you to check. &lt;q&gt;That's fine, sir,&lt;/q&gt; she assures you as she
        returns it to you. &lt;q&gt;Please move to the rear of the plane to find a
        seat.&lt;/q&gt; ";
        
        angelaGreetingState.ticketSeen = true;
    }
;
</pre></div>

<p>We've now completed all the conversation we want to implement with Pablo Cortez and the Security Guard, but this is just the start of the conversation we'll implement for Angela. In the sections that follow we'll explore what adv3Lite has to offer beyond the basic ask/tell paradigm we've illustrated here. In the meantime, for more information about implementing basic ask/tell conversation in adv3Lite, see the section on  <a href="../manual/asktell.htm">Basic Ask/Tell</a> in the <em>adv3Lite Library Manual</em>, while for more on how knowledge of objects and <span class="code">&lt;.reveal&gt;</span> tags can impact on conversation, see the section on <a href="../manual/knowledge.htm">Player Character and NPC Knowledge</a>.</p>
