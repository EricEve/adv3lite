<h1>Defining Actions</h1>

<p>The descriptions of the control column and the thrust lever clearly suggest that these items can be pushed forward or pulled back, while that of the wheel suggests it can be turned to port or starboard. Players are therefore very likely to try commands like PUSH STICK FORWARD or TURN WHEEL TO PORT, but at the moment the game won't understand these commands. Our next task is to ensure that it does. We'll start with PUSH FORWARD and PULL BACK, since this is the easier part of the task.</p>

<h2>New Grammar for Old Actions</h2>

<p>Although the descriptions of the stick and the thrust lever both suggest commands of the form PUSH STICK FORWARD and PULL LEVER BACK, there's really no reason why these shouldn't behave just the same as PUSH STICK and PULL LEVER. So we don't really need any new <em>actions</em> for either of these cases, we just need to add new ways in which the player can phrase commands that trigger the existing actions. There are basically two ways we can do this, and though there's no reason to handle PULL and PUSH differently here, we'll use one method on PUSH and the other on PULL just to illustrate both ways of doing things. We'll start with the more difficult way on PUSH and then illustrate the easier way on PULL.</p>

<p>Let's suppose we want PUSH X, PUSH X FORWARD and PUSH FORWARD ON X to all do the same thing. One way to do this is to define a new <strong>VerbRule</strong> that recognizes PUSH X FORWARD snd PUSH FORWARD ON X and makes either trigger the Push action. This is what it might look like:</p>

 <p><div class="code"><pre>
VerbRule(PushForward)
    'push' multiDobj 'forward'
    | 'push' 'forward' 'on' multiDobj
    : VerbProduction
    action = Push
    verbPhrase = 'push/pushing (what)'
    missingQ = 'what do you want to push forward'
;
</pre></div>

<p>Let's take this piece by piece. First we begin our specification of the new grammar for the Push action with <span class="code">VerbRule(PushForward)</span>. <span class="code">VerbRule()</span> tells the compiler we're defining some new grammar for an action. <span class="code">PushForward</span> is an arbitrary tag that's used to identify this VerbRule. It could have been anything we liked, so long as it's not something already used to identify another VerbRule (each VerbRule tag has to be unique), but it helps make our game code more readable if we use something meaningful.</p>

<p>The next part of the definition specifies the grammar that triggers this rule, in other words what the player has to type in order to match this VerbRule. Here it's specified as  <span class="code">'push' multiDobj 'forward' | 'push' 'forward' 'on' multiDobj</span> The vertical bar is simply used to separate options, so this is equivalent to saying that the VerbRule will be matched either by <span class="code">'push' multiDobj 'forward'</span> or by <span class="code">'push' 'forward' 'on' multiDobj</span>. In both cases <span class="code">multiDobj</span> is a placeholder for the names of one or more direct objects (the thing or things to be pushed) in the player's command. If we wanted to restrict the player to pushing one thing at a time we could specify <span class="code">singleDobj</span> here, but since the standard VerbRule for Push allows multiple direct objects, we may as well do the same here. For the rest, the strings in single-quotes ('push', 'forward' and 'on') represent what the player must actually type at this point in the command; although we specify them in lower case, the player can use either upper case or lower case or a mixture of the two.</p>

<p>The next line, <span class="code">: VerbProduction</span>, simply defines the VerbRule as being of the VerbProduction class. This will be true of every VerbRule you ever define.</p>

<p>This is followed by <span class="code">action = Push</span>. This defines which action is triggered by a command that matches this VerbRule. In this case we want to use the existing Push action.</p>

<p>The next line, <span class="code">verbPhrase = 'push/pushing forward (what)'</span>, is used by the library to construct messages like 'first pushing forward the stick' or 'first trying to push the stick'. Even if you don't think your game will ever use such messages, you should always define this property just in case, otherwise you risk getting run-time errors further down the line. </p>

<p>Finally, <span class="code">missingQ = 'what do you want to push forward'</span> defines the text of the question the parser should ask if the player neglects to supply a direct object when entering this command. (In fact, in this case, the question will never be asked, since if the player types PUSH FORWARD ON the parser will respond with "You see no forward on here" because it interprets FORWARD ON as the direct object of a PUSH command, but in principle this property should always be defined).</p>

<p>We'll now handle PULL BACK the easier way, by modifying an existing VerbRule:</p>

<p><div class="code"><pre>
modify VerbRule(Pull)
    ('pull' multiDobj ( | 'back')) |
    'pull' 'back' 'on' multiDobj    
    : 
;
</pre></div>

<p>Note how we end this definition with a colon, and then the terminating semicolon. This is just a syntactic quirk of how a VerbRule is modified in TADS 3, but in essence what we're doing is modifying an object, so we don't specify its class list again (VerbProduction) and we're leaving most of its properties (action, verbPhrase and missingQ) unchanged. What we are doing is replacing the existing grammar specification with one of our own: <span class="code">('pull' multiDobj ( | 'back')) | 'pull' 'back' 'on' multiDobj</span>. This follows exactly the same principles as before, except that we're using parentheses to group the various alternatives. The group <span class="code">( | 'back')</span> can match either 'back' or nothing at all, so that <span class="code">('pull' multiDobj ( | 'back'))</span> can match eithr PULL X or PULL X BACK. The second half of the specification matches PULL BACK ON X.</p>

<p>Whether you prefer to define a new VerbRule or modify an existing one is generally up to you. Modifying an existing rule is usually easier, but there may be cases where doing so would result in such a tangle of bracketed alternatives that defining a new VerbRule might seem simpler.</p>

<br>

<h2>Defining New Actions</h2>

<p>Although the library defines a Turn action (e.g. TURN WHEEL) and a TurnTo action for dials (e.g. TURN DIAL TO 23), it doesn't define actions corresponding to TURN WHEEL LEFT or TURN WHEEL TO STARBOARD, so we now need to define these ourselves.</p>

<p>The first part of this task is to define a pair of objects representing the two new actions, which we'll call TurnLeft and TurnRight (by convention the names of action objects in adv3Lite start with a capital letter, even though they're objects and not classes). Both actions will take a direct object (the wheel, principally), so they need to be of the TAction class (think of TAction as meaning 'Transitive Action' &mdash; an action that takes an object). The library provides a DefineTAction() macro that makes it simple to define such objects:</p>

 <p><div class="code"><pre>
DefineTAction(TurnLeft)
;

DefineTAction(TurnRight)
;
</pre></div>

<p>The next job is to define the grammar that will trigger these actions. We've already seen how to do this, using the VerbRule construct:</p>

 <p><div class="code"><pre>
VerbRule(TurnLeft)
    'turn' singleDobj (| 'to' (| 'the')) ('left' | 'port')
    : VerbProduction
    action = TurnLeft
    verbPhrase = 'turn/turning (what) left'
    missinqQ = 'what do you want to turn left'
    priority = 60
;

VerbRule(TurnRight)
    'turn' singleDobj (| 'to' (| 'the')) ('right' | 'starboard')
    : VerbProduction
    action = TurnRight
    verbPhrase = 'turn/turning (what) right'
    missinqQ = 'what do you want to turn right'
    priority = 60
;
</pre></div>

<p>The one extra thing we've added here to both definitions is <span class="code">priority = 60</span>. This is to ensure that both these VerbRules will take priority over the VerbRule for TURN X TO <em>setting</em>, where <em>setting</em> is a literal value that could be anything, including 'left', 'right', 'port' or 'starboard'. The default priority for a VerbRule is 50, so by giving these two VerbRules a priority of 60 we're ensure they're matched in preference to <span class="code">VerbRule(TurnTo)</span> for commands like TURN WHEEL TO PORT.</p>

<p>If you compile and run the game now, you'll find that it now accepts commands like TURN WHEEL TO PORT or TURN WHEEL RIGHT (provided the wheel is in scope) but that absolutely nothing happens in response. That's because we haven't yet defined what we want either of these commands to do. It's no good starting by defining what we want them to do on the wheel, since players might try to use them on any object in the game. Our next job, therefore, is to define what we want them to do on Thing. We can then customize the response on particular objects (such as the wheel) where we want the commands to do something special.</p>

<p>To do this, we need to modify the Thing class and then specify the handling of the TurnLeft and TurnRight actions in blocks marked <span class="code">dobjFor(TurnLeft)</span> and <span class="code">dobjFor(TurnRight)</span>, meaning "What do I do when I'm the direct object of TurnLeft or TurnRight command?". All we need is something like this: </p>

 <p><div class="code"><pre>
modify Thing
    dobjFor(TurnLeft)
    {
        preCond = [touchObj]
        
        verify()
        {
            if(!isTurnable)
                illogical(cannotTurnMsg);
        }
                
        report()
        {
            "Turning &lt;&lt;gActionListStr&gt;&gt; to the left has no effect. ";
        }
        
    }
    
    dobjFor(TurnRight)
    {
        preCond = [touchObj]
        
        verify()
        {
            if(!isTurnable)
                illogical(cannotTurnMsg);
        }
        
        report()
        {
            "Turning &lt;&lt;gActionListStr&gt;&gt; to the right has no effect. ";
        }
        
    }
;
</pre></div>

<p>Again, let's work through this step by step.</p>

<p>First, we define <span class="code">preCond = [touchObj]</span>. <span class="code">preCond</span> is short for preCondition. The idea is that actions often require one or more preconditions to be fulfilled before they can be carried out. A door must be open before we can go through it, a book must be visible before we can read it, we must be holding a ball before we can put it anywhere, and so on. Since such preconditions are so common, it would be tedious to have to code them every single time, so instead the library provides a number of ready-made preconditions prepackages as PreCondition objects. One of these is <span class="code">touchObj</span>, which means the actor must be able to touch the object in order to carry out the action. This is obviously needed here, since you clearly can't turn anything one way or another without touching it. We could list more than one PreCondition here if we needed to, but for these two actions <span class="code">touchObj</span> will suffice.</p>

<p>The next piece of code is the verify() method in each section:</p>

 <p><div class="code"><pre>
        verify()
        {
            if(!isTurnable)
                illogical(cannotTurnMsg);
        }
</pre></div>

<p>As has been intimated previously, verify() methods perform two functions:</p>

<ol>
<li>Guiding the parser's choice of objects in cases of ambiguity;</li>
<li>Ruling out actions that are obviously impossible or inappropriate.</li>
</ol>

<p>These two functions are handled together because if a given action on a given object is obviously impossible or inappropriate, then that object will be a poor choice for the parser to select. For example, if there's a green wheel and a green mountain, we'd like TURN GREEN to select the wheel rather than the mountain, which is what would happen if the wheel's verify() method allowed the Turn action to go ahead and the mountain's didn't.</p>

<p>The library already defines <span class="code">isTurnable</span> and <span class="code">cannotTurnMsg</span> properties for use with the Turn action, so we may as well use them here, but if they didn't exist it would be a good idea to invent them, for example if we'd implementing a Cross verb (as in CROSS BRIDGE or CROSS RIVER):</p>

 <p><div class="code"><pre>
modify Thing
    dobjFor(Cross)
    {
        preCond = [touchObj]
        verify()
        {
            if(!isCrossable)
               illogical(cannotCrossMsg);
        }
    }
    
    isCrossable = nil
    cannotCrossMsg = '{The subj dobj} {is} not something {i} {can} cross. '
;
</pre></div>

<p>The advantage of this coding pattern is that I don't then need to override the verify() method either to make something crossable or to customize the message refusing to allow it; e.g. I could just define <span class="code">cannotCrossMsg = 'It\'s flowing far too fast; you\'d drown if you tried'</span> on a river object. This becomes particularly helpful for more complex verify() methods that need to check for more conditions, such as not allowing an object to be put inside itself or anything it already contains, or not allowing an actor to pick up something he's standing on.</p>

<p>The final section we've defined on the modified Thing for TurnLeft is:</p>

 <p><div class="code"><pre>
        report()
        {
            "Turning &lt;&lt;gActionListStr&gt;&gt; to the left has no effect. ";
        }
</pre></div>

<p>What this does is probably fairly obvious: it displays a message like, "Turning the doodah to the left has no effect." How it works is rather subtler, however, and requires quite a bit of further explanation.</p>

<p>First of all, the report() phase is only called for the last object in a series of objects if a command speficies more than one direct object. So, if the grammar for TurnLeft allowed multiple direct objects, and the player typed TURN RED WHEEL, GREEN WHEEL AND BLUE WHEEL LEFT the response would be "Turning the red wheel, the green wheel and the blue wheel to the left has no effect." </p>

<p>Second, <span class="code">gActionListStr</span> only lists those objects that (a) made it to the action stage (i.e. which passed verify() and check() and met any preconditions) but (b) for which the action stage displayed no messages at all. That means that if you want any object to display a custom message of its own in response to an action, you can simply get your action() method (or any method it calls) to display it, and the report() message will be suppressed for that object. The message defined in a report() method is thus only uses as a kind of fall-back default if the game doesn't supply anything more specific.</p>

<p>Third, the report() phase won't be executed at all if either (a) <span class="code">gActionListStr</span> would be empty (i.e., if there are no direct objects left to report on) or (b) the action is an implicit one (reported via a message like "(first opening the door)").</p>

<p>From this follow a number of rules about defining a report() method:</p>

<ol>
<li>A report method should normally only be defined on a class, and normally only the Thing class, not on an object or a subclass of Thing (one reason being that if an action allows multiple direct objects you can never be sure what object the report method will be called on; if you know an action will only ever be called on a single direct object at a time you can relax this rule).</li>
<li>The message displayed by a report() method should be as general as possible, since it might apply to anything.</li>
<li>Any message displayed by a report() method should use the special pseudo-global string variable <span class="code">gActionListStr</span> to list the direct objects of the action that's just been executed. </li>
<li><span class="code">gActionListStr</span> is probably only useful in a report() method.</li>
</ol>

<p>preCond, verify() and report() are only three of the six possible phases we can use in a dobjFor() block, the other three being rmemap, check() and action(). In this particular case we don't need to define the remap, check() and action() stages on Thing, but in the next section we'll be seeing how to use them to customize the behaviour of particular objects (such as the wheel, the control stick and the thrust lever). In the meantime, if you want to learn more about defining actions you can read the sections on <a href="../manual/actres.htm">Action Results</a> and <a href="../manual/define.htm">Defining New Actions</a> in the <em>adv3Lite Library Manual</em>.</p>
