<h2>What More in the Airport Game?</h2>

<p>We've taken the Airport game as far as we need to for the purposes of this tutorial, and it can now be played through from beginning to end, but it's not exactly finished in the sense of being a fully-polished product. Quite apart from finishing off the scoring and the hints and maybe broadening the range of conversational responses there's quite a bit more that could be done if you wanted to practise your adv3Lite skills on it. For example, the description of the power cable running off from the metal detector mentions a desk, but we haven't implemented the desk. In a properly polished game there should at least be a Decoration object to represent it. Then there's the issue of where the original passengers from the plane disappear to once the player dons the pilot's uniform; perhaps they'd all go to the snack bar? The room description for the gate3 room is certainly inappropriate once the original passengers have been booted off the plane, so ideally it should be made to change according to circumstances. And why is Passenger Quixote always called to the information desk? Might we want to arrange for the name to be varied?</p>

<p>Again, more could be done with flying the plane. What happens if the player character leaves the cockpit to go and chat to Angela again while the plane is careering down the runway? Should we take steps to prevent this happening (perhaps by not allowing the player character to leave his seat while the plane is in motion?). Should Angela join the player character in the cockpit, perhaps, and what might happen if she does? Should it be necessary for the player character to take more precautions against the drug barons when he goes to fly the plane, e.g. by locking the cockpit door from the inside to prevent Pablo Cortez bursting in on him? That is, should we make Cortez burst in and upset things if the player character doesn't lock the cockpit door before attempting to fly the plane? How might we clue the player that he needs to do this? Could we extend the game a few turns beyond takeoff so that the player character actually has to turn the plane onto a certain course and radio ahead in order to win?</p>

<p>There's no compulsion for you or any other reader of this tutorial to pursue any of these questions. By now, you might well prefer to get on with your own game. But if you did want to play around with the Airport game a bit more to practise what you've learned and try out some other things, there's certainly plenty of scope.</p>

<h2>What More in adv3Lite?</h2>

<p>While we've covered most of the features of adv3Lite you're likely to use, we haven't covered absolutely everything, so for the sake of completeness we should mention the main features we haven't looked at in this tutorial and point out where you can read about them in the <em>adv3Lite Library Manual</em>.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most common IF trope we haven't even mentioned yet is that of light and darkness, i.e. creating one or more rooms that are in darkness, to which the player character has to bring a light source in order to find his/her way around. In some circles such light/darkness puzzles are rather frowned on as being tired and hackneyed, but there's nothing wrong with them if they form a natural and integral part of your story, rather than just being thrown in for the sake of a puzzle. To make a room dark in adv3Lite you just define its <span class="code">isLit</span> property to be nil. You may then want to define its <span class="code">darkName</span> and <span class="code">darkDesc</span> properties to give the name and description of the room that will be displayed while it is in darkness. There are also methods and properties you can define to determine what happens when the player character tries to travel around in the dark. For details, read the section on <a href="../manual/room.htm">Rooms and Regions</a> in the <em>adv3Lite Library Manual</em>. LIGHT SOURCES</p>

<p>Another fairly major adv3Lite feature we haven't touched on at all in this tutorial is <a href="../manual/senseregion.htm">SenseRegions</a>.</p>
