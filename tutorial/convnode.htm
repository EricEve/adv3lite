<h1>Angela Wants Answers</h1>

<p>You may recall that one of the exchanges we've defined for when the player character asks Angela what she's doing tonight is:</p>

 <p><div class="code"><pre>
       '&lt;q&gt;What &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; you doing tonight?&lt;/q&gt; you insist.\b
        &lt;q&gt;I don\'t think that\'s any of your business,&lt;/q&gt; she replies, with
        rather a bleak smile. &lt;q&gt;Do you?&lt;/q&gt; '
</pre></div>

<p>Many, if not most players will probably treat the "Do you?" at the end of Angela's reply as a purely rhetorical question, but a few may try responding YES or NO. Such a response would be appropriate only just at that point in the conversation (there may be other points at which the player could respond YES or NO, but it wouldn't meant the same thing, since it would constitute an answer to a different question). With Angela's (possibly rhetorical) question "Do you?" the conversation enters a special state, which we might call a <em>Conversation Node</em>, meaning a particular point in the conversation at which particular responses become potentially appropriate. Once the conversation moves on, these particular responses (such as a YES or DO in response to Angela's "Do you?" cease to be appropriate once more.</p>
