     *   isHer: we assume the object is neuter if it's not masculine or
     *   feminine.

     *   Languages that have grammatical gender will almost certainly want

     *   string and set isHim and isHer accordingly.
     *   
     *   The English library sets isHim and isHer if 'him' and 'her'

     *   the most convenient way to represent gender via the vocab string
     *   in English, since English doesn't have gendered articles.)
     *   
     *   Note that we define the genders as three separate properties, so
     *   the genders are NOT mutually exclusive - an object can be a "him",
     *   a "her", and an "it" at the same time.  This is because a single
     *   object can have multiple grammatical genders in some languages.
     *   In English, for example, an animal can be referred to as gendered
     *   (matching its physical gender) or neuter; and a few inanimate
     *   objects have a sort of optional, idiomatic gender, such as
     *   referring to a ship or country as "her".

     *   Some languages might need additional genders.  When needed,
     *   LMentionable should simply define suitable additional properties.

     *   In most gendered languages, the grammatical gender is an attribute
     *   of the noun, not of the object.  In particular, if an object has
     *   two nouns in its vocabulary, the two nouns might be of different
     *   genders.  The language module might therefore limit the use of
     *   isIt et al to the gender of the object's name string as it appears
     *   in output (e.g., for selecting an article when showing the name in
     *   a list, or selecting a pronoun to represent the object), and use a
     *   completely different scheme to tag the gender of individual
     *   vocabulary words.  One approach would be to use separate mNoun and

     *   up, you can override matchName() to be as picky as you like.

     *   initial score by assigning its own score value.  This routine is
     *   most useful in cases where a particular object has a special

     *   other objects in the list, if needed.

/* 
 *   A SubComponent is a Thing that is part of something else and represents the
 *   surface, container, underside or rear of the object to which it's attached.
 *   This allows a Thing to model several types of containment at once, by
 *   having (say) one SubComponent that represents its top (on which things can
 *   be placed) and another to represent its interior (in which things can be
 *   placed.
 *
 *   A SubComponent is normally defined as a nested anonymous object on the
 *   remapOn, remapIn, remapUnder or remapBehind property of a Thing. There's no
 *   need to further specify whether a SubComponent is also a Surface,
 *   Container, Underside or RearContainer, since the library can work this out
 *   from the property on which it is defined.
 *
 *   A SubComponent's 'name' property, and other related properties which
 *   control how the game refers to the object, delegate to the parent
 *   object. SubComponents assume their parent's vocabulary, but get a
 *   likelihood adjustment of -15 if their parent is also in scope. If you
 *   assign its own vocabulary, vocabulary it gets from its parent will be
 *   available in addition to that. For example, a car might have a remapIn
 *   SubComponent which can be referred to as 'interior' and a remapUnder
 *   SubComponent which can be referred to as 'undercarriage'. A car presumably
 *   has a windows and a windshield (hence isTransparent = true on the remapIn
 *   SubComponent), so if you're inside it then you can still see the exterior,
 *   and so 'car' will be matched preferentially to the parent object. However,
 *   an action such as 'TOUCH CAR', which is illogical for the exterior because
 *   it can only be seen and not reached, will instead apply to the
 *   SubComponent. On the other hand, if  you're inside a truck trailer and
 *   can't see out, then the exterior is not even in scope and so 'truck' will
 *   match on the SubComponent with no penalty applied.
 *
 *   For all purposes other than those described above, the SubComponent is a
 *   distinct object from its parent, and does not delegate any of its
 *   behavior. In particular, sense-related properties such as 'desc' are not
 *   delegated. Therefore, if the SubComponent can ever have vocabulary then
 *   you will likely want to implement some of these. Passing them through to
 *   the parent is usually not appropriate, because, e.g., the interior or the
 *   undercarriage of a car should probably be described differently than the
 *   car itself.
