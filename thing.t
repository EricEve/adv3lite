     *   
     *   The default is neuter.  Use isHim and isHer to give an object
     *   masculine and/or feminine gender.  Use isIt to explicitly give an
     *   object neuter gender.  By default, we infer isIt from isHim and
     *   isHer: we assume the object is neuter if it's not masculine or
     *   feminine.
     *   
     *   Languages that have grammatical gender will almost certainly want
     *   to parse articles in the 'vocab' property to make it more
     *   convenient to encode each object's gender.  For example, a French
     *   implementation could parse 'le' or 'la' at the start of a vocab
     *   string and set isHim and isHer accordingly.
     *   
     *   The English library sets isHim and isHer if 'him' and 'her'
     *   (respectively) are found in the object's pronoun list.  (This is
     *   the most convenient way to represent gender via the vocab string
     *   in English, since English doesn't have gendered articles.)
     *   
     *   Note that we define the genders as three separate properties, so
     *   the genders are NOT mutually exclusive - an object can be a "him",
     *   a "her", and an "it" at the same time.  This is because a single
     *   object can have multiple grammatical genders in some languages.
     *   In English, for example, an animal can be referred to as gendered
     *   (matching its physical gender) or neuter; and a few inanimate
     *   objects have a sort of optional, idiomatic gender, such as
     *   referring to a ship or country as "her".  
     *   
     *   Some languages might need additional genders.  When needed,
     *   LMentionable should simply define suitable additional properties.
     *   
     *   In most gendered languages, the grammatical gender is an attribute
     *   of the noun, not of the object.  In particular, if an object has
     *   two nouns in its vocabulary, the two nouns might be of different
     *   genders.  The language module might therefore limit the use of
     *   isIt et al to the gender of the object's name string as it appears
     *   in output (e.g., for selecting an article when showing the name in
     *   a list, or selecting a pronoun to represent the object), and use a
     *   completely different scheme to tag the gender of individual
     *   vocabulary words.  One approach would be to use separate mNoun and
     *   fNoun token properties (and more if needed) to distinguish the

     *   Occasionally, though, there are reasons to be pickier.  When these
     *   come up, you can override matchName() to be as picky as you like.
     *   
     *   The most common situation where pickiness is called for is when

     *   unnecessary.  Overriding matchName() to be picky about word order
     *   for those specific objects can often fix this.
     *   
     *   Another example is ensuring the user knows the correct full name
     *   of an object as part of a puzzle: you can override matchName() to
     *   make sure the user doesn't accidentally stumble on the object by
     *   using one of its vocabulary words to refer to something else

     *   routine on each object it's considering as a match.
     *   
     *   Our job here is to read the player's mind.  The question before us
     *   is: did the player mean *this* object when typing this noun
     *   phrase?  Obviously we can't really know what's in the player's
     *   mind, but in many cases we can make an educated guess based on
     *   what ought to make the most sense in context.  The context in this
     *   case is the state of the simulated game world, as it's portrayed
     *   to the player.  That last bit is important: be cognizant of what
     *   the player is *meant* to know at this point.  DON'T base the score
     *   on information that the player isn't supposed to know, though:
     *   that could give away secrets that the player is meant to discover
     *   on her own.
     *   
     *   Before this routine is called, the Action has already assigned an
     *   initial score to each object, but this routine can override the
     *   initial score by assigning its own score value.  This routine is
     *   most useful in cases where a particular object has a special
     *   affinity for a verb, or for the verb in combination with
     *   particular other objects involved in the command.
     *   
     *   'cmd' is the Command object.  'role' is the noun phrase's role in
     *   the command (DirectObject, IndirectObject, etc).  'lst' is a list
     *   of NPMatch objects identifying the objects that matched the noun
     *   phrase.  'm' is the NPMatch object for self.
     *   
     *   To override or adjust the score, simply set m.score to the new
     *   value.  This routine is also free to override the scores of any
     *   other objects in the list, if needed.
     *   
     *   By default, we don't make any adjustment - we simply accept the
     *   initial score calculated by the Action, by leaving m.score
     *   unchanged.
