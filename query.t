 *   Q is the general-purpose global Query object.  Its various methods are
 *   used to ask questions about the game state.
 *   
 *   For any query, there are two sources of answers.  First, there's the
 *   standard answer based on the basic "physics" of the adventure world
 *   model.  Second, there are any number of custom answers from Special
 *   objects, which define customizations that apply to specific
 *   combinations of actors, locations, objects, times, or just about
 *   anything else that the game can model.
 *   
 *   The standard physics-based answer is the default.  It provides the
 *   answer if there are no active Special objects that provide custom
 *   answers.
 *   
 *   If there are active Specials, the only ones that matter for a
 *   particular query are the ones that define that query's method.  If
 *   there are any active Special objects that define a query method,
 *   calling Q.foo() actually calls the highest-priority Special's version
 *   of the foo() method.  That Special method can in turn call the next
 *   lower priority Special using next().  If there are no active Special
 *   objects defining a query method, the default handler in QDefaults will
 *   be used automatically.

     *   change when the game-world state changes, you can simply sort the
