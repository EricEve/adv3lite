/*
 *   Treat an object definition as equivalent to another object definition.
 *   These can be used immediately after a dobjFor() or iobjFor() to treat
 *   the first action as though it were the second.  So, if the player types
 *   "search box", and we want to treat the direct object the same as for
 *   "look in box", we could make this definition for the box:
 *   
 *   dobjFor(Search) asDobjFor(LookIn)
 *   
 *   Note that no semicolon is needed after this definition, and that this
 *   definition is completely in lieu of a regular property set for the
 *   object action.
 *   
 *   In general, a mapping should NOT change the role of an object:
 *   dobjFor(X) should not usually be mapped using asIobjFor(Y), and
 *   iobjFor(X) shouldn't be mapped using asDobjFor(Y).  The problem with
 *   changing the role is that the handler routines often assume that the
 *   object is actually in the role for which the handler was written; a
 *   verify handler might refer to '{dobj}' in generating a message, for
 *   example, so reversing the roles would give the wrong object in the role.
 *   
 *   Role reversals should always be avoided, but can be used if necessary
 *   under conditions where all of the code involved in the TARGET of the
 *   mapping can be carefully controlled to ensure that it doesn't make
 *   assumptions about object roles, but only references 'self'.  Reversing
 *   roles in a mapping should never be attempted in general-purpose library
 *   code, because code based on the library could override the target of the
 *   role-reversing mapping, and the override could fail to observe the
 *   restrictions on object role references.
 *   
 *   Note that role reversals can almost always be handled with other
 *   mechanisms that handle reversals cleanly.  Always consider Doer.doInstead()
 *   first when confronted with a situation that seems to call for a
 *   role-reversing asObjFor() mapping, as doInstead() specifically allows for
 *   object role changes.

 *   DMsg() - default English library message cover macro.
 *   
 *   Whenever the library displays a message, it uses the DMsg() macro.  The
 *   arguments are a message ID, and the default English message text to
 *   display.  The message ID is a string that identifies the message; this
 *   is used to look for overriding customizations of the message.  Refer to
 *   the CustomMessages class for information on customizing the standard
 *   library messages.
 *   
 *   In our approach, the library defines the default English text of the
 *   messages in-line, directly in the code.  On the surface, this is
 *   contrary to standard practices in most modern programming projects,
 *   which strive to make translations easier by separating the message text
 *   from the program code, gathering all of the text into a central message
 *   file that can be replaced for each language.  Despite appearances, we're
 *   accomplishing the same thing - but in our system, we have the advantage
 *   that we *also* define the default English message text in-line as part
 *   of the code it applies to.  This makes it easier to read the code by
 *   keeping a message and its full context in one place; this way you don't
 *   have to shuttle between the code and message file.
 *   
 *   Here's how we accomplish the message separation required for
 *   translations, and also for games that wish to customize the library
 *   defaults.  The DMsg() macro requires both the default English message
 *   text *and* an ID key for the message.  The message display function
 *   receives both.  The display function proceeds to look up the ID key in a
 *   translation table; if it finds an entry, it uses the version of the
 *   message in the translation table instead of the English default passed
 *   in via DMsg().  A language module can provide a message table that
 *   defines the language translations, and a game can provide a table that
 *   further customizes the library messages to fit its narrative style.
 *   
 *   There's one additional element.  Translators and game authors need to be
 *   able to see all of the messages in one place, so they can create their
 *   tables.  We would seem to lack that central list of English messages.
 *   Fortunately, by using a standard macro for each message, we can extract
 *   a comprehensive English message list automatically via a special tool.
 *   We use this as part of the library release process to create the English
 *   message file for reference.
 *   
 *   Note that the macro expansion includes the default English text only in
 *   English builds.  It omits the text in non-English builds.  This is to
 *   save space - we assume that the English messages will all be overridden
 *   anyway by each translated library version, so there's no point in
 *   including their text in the final compiled program.
