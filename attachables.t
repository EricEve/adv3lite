 *
 *
 *   The attachables file provides a framework for simple and common case
 *   attachables.
 *
 *   It treats attachment as an asymmetric relationship. ATTACH A TO B is not
 *   the same as ATTACH B TO A. It also treats it as a many-to-one relationship:
 *   the object that is attached can only be attached to one object at a time,
 *   but the object it's attached to can have multiple objects attached to it.
