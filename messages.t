     *   objects (Present, Past, Perfect, Past Perfect, Future, Future
     *   Perfect).  This controls the way {verb} substitution parameters
     *   are generated, which in turn affects most library messages.  The
     *   default is Present, which is the conventional tense for most IF.
     *   
     *   Examples of the English tenses:
     *   
     *.    Present: Bob opens the box.
     *.    Past: Bob opened the box.
     *.    Perfect: Bob has opened the box.
     *.    Past Perfect: Bob had opened the box.
     *.    Future: Bob will open the box.
     *.    Future Perfect: Bob will have opened the box.
     *   
     *   (Language modules are free to add their own tenses if the target
     *   language has others that would be of interest to IF authors.
     *   They're also free to ignore any of the "standard" tenses we
     *   define.  At a minimum, though, some form of present tense should
     *   always be provided, since most IF is narrated in the present.  If
     *   you need to differentiate among different present tenses, you
     *   might prefer to define your own IDs instead of using the generic
     *   Present, but you should still support *some* present tense that's
     *   suitable for narration.  Some type of past tense usable in
     *   narration is also nice to have.  The others are probably of
     *   marginal value; in English, at least, other tenses are rare in any
     *   kind of narrative fiction, and are mostly limited to experimental
     *   or novelty use.)

 *   Show a message.
 *
 *   This looks for a customized version of the message text, as defined in
 *   CustomMessages objects.  If we don't find one, we use the provided default
 *   message text.
 *
 *   Substitution parameters take the form {x y z} - curly braces with one or
 *   more space-delimited tokens.  The first token is the parameter name, and
 *   any additional tokens are arguments.  The parameter names and their
 *   arguments are up to the language module to define.
 *
 *   In addition to the parameters, the string itself can have two sections,
 *   separated by a vertical bar, '|'.  The first section (before the bar) is
 *   the "terse" string, which is for a straightforward acknowledgment of a
 *   simple, ordinary action: "Taken", "Dropped", etc. The terse string is used
 *   only if the Command argument's actor is the player character, AND the
 *   command doesn't have any disambiguated objects.  If these conditions aren't
 *   met, the second half of the string, the "verbose" version, is used.
 *
 *   Once we have the message text, we perform parameter substitutions.
 *   Parameters can be provided as strings, which are substituted in literally;
 *   or as objects, whose names are inserted according to the grammar in the
 *   template text.
