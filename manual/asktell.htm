<h1>Basic Ask/Tell</h1>

<p>The adv3Lite libary is capable of some quite sophisticated conversational effects, but it is also scalable, so that if all your game needs is a basic ASK/TELL conversation system it can be implemented quite simply (and in a manner very similar to that in the adv3 library). In any case, it probably makes sense to try to understand how to implement the basic ASK/TELL system before going on to try the more sophisticated conversational features the adv3Lite library has to offer.</p>

<p>By basic ASK/TELL we mean a conversational system that allows an NPC to respond to conversational commands of the form ASK BOB ABOUT TOWER or TELL BOB ABOUT VISIT in a relatively stateless kind of way (stateless in the sense that the conversation has no particular thread or direction to it; it's simply driven by what the player chooses to talk about at any particular moment in time). </p>

<p>Implementing a basic ask/tell conversation system in adv3Lite is quite similar to the way one defines a <a href="topicentry.htm">Consultable</a>, namely by defining the conversational responses on the apprpropriate kinds of TopicEntry, either an <strong>AskTopic</strong> (to respond to ASK X ABOUT Y) or a <strong>TellTopic</strong> (to respond to TELL X ABOUT Y). There's also an <strong>AskTellTopic</strong> that responds to either. To use one of these conversational TopicEntry types we define the object or Topic it matches, or the list of objects and/or topics it matches, on its matchObj property, and the resultant conversational exchange on the topicResponse property, all of which we can do succinctly via the TopicEntry templates. The AskTopic, TellTopic or AskTellTopic is then located either in the appropriate actor, or in one of the actor's ActorStates. TopicEntries located in an ActorState are only reachable when the actor is in that ActorState, when they take priority over any TopicEntries located directly in the actor.</p>

<p>To give a simple example:</p>
 <p><div class="code"><pre>
bob: Actor 'Bob; short; man; him'
   "He's a short man, with a permanently worried-looking expression. "
;

+ AskTopic @darkTower
   &quot;&lt;q&gt;What do you know about the dark tower?&lt;/q&gt; you ask.\b
    &lt;q&gt;You don't want to go there,&lt;/q&gt; he tells you with a little shudder,
    &lt;q&gt;you really don't.&lt;/q&gt; &quot;
;

+ TellTopic [tVisit, darkTower]
   &quot;&lt;q&gt;I visited the dark tower earlier today,&lt;/q&gt; you announce.
   Bob shakes his head and looks distinctively uncomfortable.\b
   &lt;q&gt;You shouldn't have done that,&lt;/q&gt; he chides you. &lt;q&gt;But at least
    you didn't go at night. You &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; don't want to go there
    at night!&lt;/q&gt; &quot;
;

+ AskTellTopic @tWeather
   &quot;&lt;q&gt;Nice weather we're having, don't you think?&lt;/q&gt; you ask.\b
   &lt;q&gt;Not bad,&lt;/q&gt; he concurs. &quot;
;
</pre></div>

<br>
<h2>Varying the Response</h2>

<p>Although the previous example might do for a game in which Bob is little more than a device for dishing out information about the dark tower, it doesn't make him very life-like. If he's repeatedly asked the same question he will repeatedly give the same answer, like a robot or a talking book. One way of making an actor seem just a litte more life-like is to vary the responses given to the same question, even if only a little. The easiest way to do that is to mix a TopicEntry class in with an EventList class, and then use the eventList property to give a list of different responses, each of which can be used in turn. Once again the TopicEntry template makes it possible to do this in a succinct way, for example:</p>

 <p><div class="code"><pre>
 + AskTopic, StopEventList @darkTower
   [
      '&lt;q&gt;What do you know about the dark tower?&lt;/q&gt; you ask.\b
      &lt;q&gt;You really don\'t want to go there,&lt;/q&gt; he tells you with a little shudder,
      &lt;q&gt;you really don't.&lt;/q&gt;',
      
      '&lt;q&gt;What\'s so bad about the dark tower?&lt;/q&gt; you want to know.\b
       &lt;q&gt;It all goes back to -- no, it\'s best not to talk about it,&lt;/q&gt; he breaks
       off. ',
       
      '&lt;q&gt;Why don\'t you want to talk about the dark tower?&lt;/q&gt; you ask.\b
       In reply Bob merely shakes his head and mutters something inaudible. '
      
   ]
;
 </pre></div>
<p>A TopicEntry can be mixed-in with event EventList class like this, but for this type of situation a StopEventList is usually the most appropriate.</p>
<br>

<h2>Conditional Responses</h2>

<p>Even with a basic ask/tell system there are probably occasions when you want to vary the response according to some condition. For example, you might want the player character to say something quite different about his visit to the dark tower depending on whether or not he's actually seen it yet. You could do this by writing a topicResponse() method with lots of if statements in it, but the adv3Lite library offers a better way: defining multiple TopicEntries that match the same objects but using a combination of there matchScore and isActive properties to determine which one is chosen. For example:</p>

 <p><div class="code"><pre>
+ TellTopic [tVisit, darkTower]
   &quot;&lt;q&gt;I'm thinking of making a visit to the dark tower later today,&lt;/q&gt; you
    announce. &lt;q&gt;I've heard so much about it, I want to see it for myself.&lt;/q&gt;\b
    &lt;q&gt;No you don't,&lt;/q&gt; he warns you. &lt;q&gt;Curiosity killed the cat, and there
    are some things worse than death -- &lt;i&gt;much&lt;/i&gt; worse. If you value your
    immortal soul you won't go anywhere near that evil place!&lt;/q&gt;&quot;
;


+ TellTopic +110 [tVisit, darkTower]
   &quot;&lt;q&gt;I visited the dark tower earlier today,&lt;/q&gt; you announce.
   Bob shakes his head and looks distinctively uncomfortable.\b
   &lt;q&gt;You shouldn't have done that,&lt;/q&gt; he chides you. &lt;q&gt;But at least
    you didn't go at night. You &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; don't want to go there
    at night!&lt;/q&gt; &quot;
    
    isActive = (gPlayerChar.hasSeen(darkTower))
;
</pre></div>

<p>In this above example, if the player types TELL BOB ABOUT VISIT or T TOWER before the player character has seen the dark tower, the first response ("I'm thinking of visiting...") will be displayed, since the isActive property of the second one will be false. But if the player types T VISIT or TELL BOB ABOUT TOWER after the player character has seen the dark tower, then the isActive property of the second response ("I visited the dark tower...") will be true, and since it has the higher matchScore, it will be the one chosen. The <span class="code">+110</span> in the template gives the second TellTopic a matchScore of 110, which is higher than the default value of 100.</p>

<p>You can of course simply make a TopicEntry unreachable until its isActive property becomes true, without providing an alternative TopicEntry that matches the same topic or topics; indeed, this is probably a common situation. But it then raises the problem of what to do instead; i.e. how to cope with the situation where the player types ASK BOB ABOUT X or TELL BOB ABOUT Y and we haven't defined a response (or at least a currently available response) for X or Y. The best way to cope with that is by the use of DefaultTopics, which is what we shall look at next.</p>
<br>

<h2>Default Responses</h2>

<p>However many AskTopics and TellTopics you define for each NPC in your game, the people playing your game will inevitably try to ask or tell your NPCs about topics you haven't covered. In that case, you need to make your NPCs respond in a way that doesn't too blatantly declare "I have not been programmed to respond in this area", while also making it clear to the player that the topic enquired about isn't worth pursuing. For this purpose you can define a <strong>DefaultAskTopic</strong> and a <strong>DefaultTellTopic</strong> to respond to attempts to ask or tell the NPC about topics you haven't specifically allowed for. You can also define a <p>DefaultAskTellTopic</p> to cover both.</p>

<p>How much effort you need to put into this depends on how important your NPC is to your game. For a minor NPC or a game which in primarily puzzle-driven as opposed to character-driven (say) it might suffice to do this:</p>
 <p><div class="code"><pre>
+ DefaultAskTellTopic
    "Bob merely shrugs and shakes his head. "
;</pre></div>

<p>In a game where the characters are more important, and you want to give them a bit more personality and make them a bit more lifelike, you'll probably want to define a separate DefaultAskTopic and DefaultTellTopic for at least each of the major NPCs, and you'll probably want to vary the response they give by mixing in the DefaultTopic class with an EventList class, ShuffledEventList probably being the best for this situation. You may also want to use these DefaultTopics to add to the characterization of your NPCs.</p>

<p>Writing the DefaultTellTopic is probably easier, since here you can have the NPC apparently react to what the player character supposedly says:</p>

 <p><div class="code"><pre>
+ DefaultTellTopic, ShuffledEventList
  [
     '&lt;q&gt;Fascinating!&lt;/q&gt; Bob declares. ',
     '&lt;q&gt;Well I never!&lt;/q&gt; says Bob. ',
     '&lt;q&gt;How interesting!&lt;/q&gt; Bob remarks. ',
     'Bob listens intently to your every word. ',
     '&lt;q&gt;Yes, indeed!&lt;/q&gt;, says Bob. '
  ]
;
</pre></div>

<p>Defining the DefaultAskTopic follows the same principles, but can be a little trickier, since you have to give the NPC a plausible reason for refusing to answer, but you can't have him plead ignorance, otherwise you might end up with exchanges like the following:</p>


<p><div class="cmdline"><pre>
<strong>&gt;ask bob about his mother.</strong>
&quot;I wouldn't know about that,&quot; he tells you.

<strong>&gt;ask bob about himself</strong>
&quot;I haven't the foggiest notion,&quot; Bob confesses.

<strong>&gt;ask bob about the weather</strong>
&quot;I don't know anything about it," he insists.
</pre></div>

<p>A DefaultAskTopic might look like this:</p>
 <p><div class="code"><pre>
+ DefaultAskTopic
   [
      '&lt;q&gt;Let\'s change the subject,&lt;/q&gt; he suggests with a wry smile. ',
      'Halfway through your question Bob erupts into a fit of coughing. ',
      'He responds with an expressive shrug. ',
      '&lt;q&gt;Let me see,&lt;/q&gt; he begins, suddenly breaking off with a deep frown 
       as some random train of thought apparently leads him off in another direction. ',
      '&lt;q&gt;Where would you like me to start?&lt;/q&gt; he riposts, smiling gently.
      &lt;q&gt;Maybe some other time.&lt;/q&gt; '
      
   ]
;</pre></div>

<p>You may still get some incongruous responses, that's almost impossible to avoid given that the player is free to type absolutely anything, but on the whole this type of approach should be acceptable.</p>

<p>One final point to note: if you put a DefaultTopic in an ActorState it will mask any corresponding TopicEntries located directly in the Actor (which that ActorState is current). For example, if you put a DefaultAskTopic in the BobAnimatedState ActorState, then while BobAnimatedState is the current ActorState, no AskTopics directly located in Bob will be reachable. This may or may not be what you want. If it isn't. don't put any DefaultTopics in the ActorState.</p>
