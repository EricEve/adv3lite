<h1>Extras</h1>
<p>The adv3Lite library has been devised to minimize the number of classes a game author has to remember, so that a huge number of game objects can simply be defined as belonging to the Thing class. That may suit some game authors but not all. Authors used to the adv3 library may prefer to use the classes they are familiar with from there. Also, while using a greater number of classes means you have to remember more initially, it may make your code more readable in the long term, since assigning an object to an appropriate class may make it more immediately obvious what its function is.</p>

<p>To give game authors the choice of using a larger array of classes if they so wish, the extras.t module defines a number of classes that work more or less the same as the similarly named classes in adv3. Note that the 'shallow' classes add little or no real functionality to the adv3Lite library, however, since in most cases they simply define one or two properties that game authors could equally well define for themselves on Thing. There are, however, one or two classes in the extras.t module that do a little more than that (particularly the TravelConnector classes), and it will usually prove better to make use of these 'deeper' classes than attempting to roll your own on Thing if you want their full functionality.</p>

<a name="shallow"></a><h2>Shallow Equivalents to adv3 Classes</h2>

<p>We start with the 'shallow' classes that simply define one or two properties on Thing:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Container</b>: Subclass of Thing with contType = In and isOpen = true.</li>
<li><b>OpenableContainer</b>: Subclass of Container with isOpen = nil and isOpenable = true.</li>
<li><b>LockableContainer</b>: Subclass of OpenableContainer with lockability = lockableWithoutKey.</li>
<li><b>KeyedContainer</b>: Subclass of OpenableContainer with lockability = lockableWithKey.</li>
<li><b>Surface</b>: Subclass of Thing with contType = On.</li>
<li><b>Platform</b>: Subclass of Surface with isBoardable = true.</li>
<li><b>Booth</b>: Subclass of Container with isEnterable = true.</li>
<li><b>Underside</b>: Subclass of Thing with contType = Under.</li>
<li><b>RearContainer</b>: Subclass of Thing with contType = Behind.</li>
<li><b>Wearable</b>: Subclass of Thing with isWearable = true.</li>
<li><b>Food</b>: Subclass of Thing with isEdible = true.</li>
<li><b>Fixture</b>: Subclass of Thing with isFixed = true.</li>
<li><b>Decoration</b> Subclass of Thing with isDecoration = true.</li>
<li><b>Distant</b>: Subclass of Decoration with a notImportantMsg that says the object is too far away.</li>
<li><b>Heavy</b>: Subclass of Fixture with a cannotTakeMsg that says the object is too heavy.</li> 
<li><b>Switch</b>: Subclass of Thing with isSwitchable = true.</li>
</ul>

<p>Remember, you can use as many or as few of these classes as you wish.</p>
<a name="travelconn"></a>
<h2>TravelConnector Classes</h2>

<p>The following classes implement one or two TravelConnector objects that are also present as physical objects in the game world:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>StairwayUp</b>: Can be used for anything the player character might climb or climb up, typically a flight of stairs leading up, but could be used for a tree, mast, ladder or 
hillside.</li>
<li><b>StairwayDown</b> Can be used for anything the player character might climb down.</li>
<li><b>Passage</b>: Can be used for anything the player character might enter or go through to reach another destination.</li>
<li><b>PathPassage</b>: Like a Passage, except that following it also traverses it.</li>
</ul>

<p>These classes work just a little differently from their adv3 equivalents, in that you don't have to use them in pairs. To use one of the above classes, put an instance in the appropriate room, set its destination property to the room you want it to lead to, and set the appropriate direction property of the room to point to it. For example, to implement a flight of stairs leading up from the hall to the landing you might write:</p>

<p><div class=code><pre>
hall: Room 'Hall'
    "A broad flight of stairs leads up to the landing above. "
    up = hallStairs
;

+ hallStairs 'flight[n] of stairs; broad; steps staircase'
     destination = landing
;

</pre></div>

<h2><a name="emanation">Sensory Emanation Classes</a></h2>

<p>The adv3Lite library defines the classes <b>Noise</b> and <b>Odor</b> to represent a sound and a smell respectively. Users familiar with adv3 should note that these classes are much simpler than the adv3 classes with the same name (and are more like the adv3 SimpleNoise and SimpleOdor classes). They are simply Decoration objects that can be either listened to (for a Noise) or smelled (for an Odor), either of which is treated as the same as examining them. For anything else they respond with 'You can't do that to a noise|smell. ' Since they don't by default define smellDesc or listenDesc they won't normally respond to an intransitive SMELL or LISTEN command. They can, however, be used to provide simple implementations of any smells or sounds whose existence is suggested by smelling or listening to other objects, or by issuing an intransitive SMELL or LISTEN command. For example:</p>


<p><div class=code><pre>
+ cooker: Thing 'cooker;blackened;oven stove top'
    "Normally, you keep it in pretty good shape (or your cleaner does) but right
    now it's looking suspiciously blackened, especially round the top. "    
    
    isFixed = true
    isSwitchable = true
    isOn = true
    
    smellDesc = "There's a distinct smell of burning from the cooker. "
;


+ Odor 'smell of burning; acrid distinct'
    "It smells quite acrid. "   
;
</pre></div>

<a name="misc"></a><h2>Other Miscellaneous Classes</h2>

<p>The <b>Flashlight</b> is a subclass of Switch that lights up when its switched on, and goes out when its switched off. It can also be switched on and off with LIGHT and EXTINGUISH.</p>

<p>An <b>Immovable</b> is like a Fixture, except that taking it is blocked in check() rather than verify(). What this is means is that although it can't be taken, this doesn't affect the parser's choice of it as the target of a TAKE command. This could be used for anything that looks like it might be possible to take, but turns out not to be takeable (perhaps because it's heavier than it looks, or it's fastened in place but not obviously so).

<a name="unthing"></a>
<p>An <strong>Unthing</strong> is an object that used to represent the <em>absence</em> of something that a player might assume to be present. The purpose of an Unthing is simply to provide a message explaining why the thing in question isn't there. For example, if the player drops a key down a drain, you could then add an Unthing to the location to remind the player why the key is 
no longer available:</p>

 <p><div class="code"><pre>
unKey: Unthing 'small silver key'
   'Unfortunately, you dropped the silver key down the drain. '
;   
</pre></div>

<p>Note that the second property we're defining with the template here is not the description but the <strong>notHereMsg</strong>, and that this must be a single-quoted string. Any attempt to perform any action with an Unthing will result in the display of its notHereMsg.</p>

<p>When choosing objects the parser will always prefer any other object to an Unthing. So, in the previous example, if the unKey was in scope at the same time as a large brass key, say, the parser will always choose the large brass key in respond to commands that just refer to a 'key', e.g. X KEY, TAKE KEY or UNLOCK DOOR WITH KEY.</p>

<p>The Unthing class inherits from Decoration. You can make selected actions work with an Unthing by overriding is decorationActions property. E.g. if you'd defined a RETRIEVE command which you wanted to work on the UnKey (to make the player character try to fish the real silver key out of the drain, maybe), you could define your unKey thus:</p>

 <p><div class="code"><pre>
unKey: Unthing 'small silver key'
   'Unfortunately, you dropped the silver key down the drain. '
   
   decorationActions = [Retrieve]
;   
</pre></div>


<p>A <strong><a name="secretdoor">SecretDoor</a></strong> is a Door that only acts like a Door when it's open. When it's closed it's either totally invisible, or it appears to be something else, such as a bookcase or a panel.</p>

<p>To use a SecretDoor, define it just like a <a href="door.htm">Door</a>, but (assuming it starts out closed) define its <span class="code">vocab</span> property to be whatever's suitable for its closed state, and a separate <strong>vocabWhenOpen</strong> property to define the name and other vocab to use when it's open. For example:</p>

 <p><div class="code"><pre>
cellar: Room 'Cellar' 'cellar'
    "It's not a pleasant place at the best of times, dark, dank and smelly, with
    piles of old junk strewn all over the place waiting for you to find time to
    sort them out (which you probably never will). A wine rack stands &lt;&lt;unless
      wineRack.isOpen&gt;&gt; empty against the east wall&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;open to the east,
    revealing a passage beyond&lt;&lt;end&gt;&gt;. "
    
    isLit = nil
    darkName = 'Cellar (in the dark)'
    darkDesc = "It's too dark to see anything down here, but you could just
        about find your way back up to the kitchen. "
    up = kitchen
    west = wineRack
    
    regions = downstairs
;

+ wineRack: SecretDoor 'wine rack; empty'
    "It's empty; you never got round to restocking it. &lt;&lt;if isOpen&gt;&gt;It's also
    open, revealing a dark passage behind.&lt;&lt;end&gt;&gt; "
    
    afterAction()
    {
       if(gActionIs(Jump) && !isOpen)
        {
            "The vibration causes the wine rack to swing open, revealing a dark
            passage beyond. ";
            makeOpen(true);
        }
    
    }
    otherSide = dpDoor
    
    vocabWhenOpen = 'dark passage; empty wine; rack'
;
</pre></div>

<p>Note that the OPEN command won't work on a <span class="code">SecretDoor</span> when it's closed, but the CLOSE command will work on a <span class="code">SecretDoor</span> when it's open (unless you override the isOpenable property to make it do otherwise). The default assumption is that a <span class="code">SecretDoor</span> has to be opened by some non-standard and probably non-obvious means.</p>

<p>If (exceptionally) a SecretDoor starts out open you can define its <strong>vocabWhenClosed</strong> property to specify the name and vocab to use for it when it's closed.</p>

<p>If you want a SecretDoor to be effectively invisible when it's closed, you could give it a vocab property comprising an empty string and make sure nothing else mentions it when it's closed, but it's probably easier just to make it a Door and define <span class="code">isHidden = !isOpen</span>, for example:</p>

 <p><div class="code"><pre>
loft: Room 'Hay Loft' 'hay loft'
    "There's not much up here, apart from a few stray strands of straw
    scattered across the bare boards. A ladder leads back down to the
    main part of the barn below. "
    down = ladderDown
    west = loftDoor
    
;

+ Decoration 'straw; stray of; strands'
;
    
+ Decoration 'bare boards;;them'
;

+ ladderDown: StairwayDown 'ladder'
    destination = barn
    
    dobjFor(Pull)
    {
        action()
        {
            if(loftDoor.isOpen)
            {
                "Pulling the ladder causes the secret door to close again. ";
                loftDoor.makeOpen(nil);
            }
            else
            {
                "Pulling the ladder causes a secret door to open to the west,
                revealing a small compartment beyond. ";
                loftDoor.makeOpen(true);                
            }
        }
    }
;

+ loftDoor: Door 'small compartment;secret;door''
    "It looks only just big enough to enter. "
    otherSide = compartmentDoor   
    
    specialDesc = "A small compartment has opened up to the west. "
    useSpecialDesc = isOpen
    isHidden = !isOpen
;


smallCompartment: Room 'Small Compartment' 'small compartment'
   "There's only just enough room to stand in here. "
    otherSide = loftDoor
    
    east = compartmentDoor
    out asExit(east)
;

+ compartmentDoor: Door 'small door'
    otherSide = loftDoor
;
</pre></div>

<p>Note that in both these example, the <span class="code">west</span> exit will only be displayed in the exit lister when the corresponding SecretDoor is open. When a SecretDoor is closed then, for travel purposes, it behaves as if there's no exit through it, even though it's attached to an exit property like a standard Door.</p>
