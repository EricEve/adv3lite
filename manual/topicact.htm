<h1>Topic Actions</h1>

<p>At first sight TopicActions (and TopicTActions) look a little like LiteralActions, in that they involved <em>grammatical</em> objects that aren't (or may not be) implemented as physical objects in the simulated world model Interactive Fiction occasionally involved commands that act on literal text rather than game object. For example, the command THINK ABOUT DEMOCRACY, is a command to think about the topic of democracy, , not a command involving any physical simulated object called Democracy. Similarly, the command LOOK UP DEMOCRACY IN DICTIONARY is a command to look up the topic of democracy in a book; the dictionary is a physical game object, but the topic is not. The first of these commands is a <strong>TopicAction</strong>, and the second is a <strong>TopicTAction</strong>.</p> 

<p>But there is an important difference between topics and literals. Whereas the literal target of a LiteralAction or LiteralTAction is never an object defined in game code, the topic target of a TopicAction or TopicTAction usually is. The target may be a <a href="topic.htm">Topic</a> or it may be a physical game object (i.e. a Thing) referred to as though it were a Topic (for example there could be an orb of destiny object defined as a Thing in the game that can be thought about via a THINK ABOUT ORB OF DESTINY command).</p>

<p>In this section we shall see how to work with and define both types of action.</p>

<a name="working"></a><h2>Working with TopicActions and TopicTActions</h2>

<p>If the player issues a TopicAction command (e.g. THINK ABOUT DEMOCRACY) the topic element of the command ends up in gCommand.dobj. It the player issues a TopicTAction the topic element may end up in either gCommand.dobj or gCommand.iobj, depending on the <em>grammatical</em> role of the topic. So, for example, if the command were CONSULT DICTIONARY ABOUT DEMOCRACY, the topic element would end up in gCommand.iobj. As with LiteralTActions so with TopicTActions, the library may swap the Command object's iobj and dobj round so that the curDobj of the action is always the physical object involved, and the curIobj holds the topic.</p>

<p>But what do we mean by 'the topic' in this case? The curDobj of a TopicAction, or the curIobj of a TopicTAction, always ends up pointing to a <strong>ResolvedTopic</strong> object. This is a wrapper for all the Topics and Things matched by the command, and defines the following properties and methods:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>topicList</strong>: a list of all the Things and Topics known to the player character that match the player's input</li>
<li><strong>tokens</strong>: a list of the tokens (individual words) the player used to refer to the topic</li>
<li><strong>getTopicText</strong>: a reconstruction of the text the player used to describe the topic, reconstructed by concatenating the tokens.</li>
<li><strong>theName</strong>: simply returns the value of getTopicText; this can be useful in contexts where code expects any Mentionable to define a theName property.</li>
</ul>

<p>For example, if the player typed the command THINK ABOUT BALL, and the game included a redBall object, a blueBall object, and a tGalaBall Topic, the topicList property of the resulting ResolvedTopic would contain [redBall, blueBall, tGalaBall] and the tokens property ['ball']. If, however, the player had typed THINK ABOUT GALA BALL the topicList property would have held just [tGalaBall] and the tokens property ['gala', 'ball'] (assuming the the player character knows about all three objects at the time the command is issued).</p>

<p>If the player types a command involving a topic that doesn't match any Thing or Topic the player character knows about (either because no such Thing or Topic exists in the game, or because the player character is yet to learn of its existence), the parser creates a temporary new Topic object and places it in the topicList of the ResolvedTopic. Whatever the player used to describe the topic is assigned to the temporary Topic's vocab property, and hence to its name property. The temporary Topic object is anonymous and won't match any Topic or Thing defined in game code, but its getTopicText() property could be matched to a regular expression, for example (the <a href="topicentry.htm">TopicEntry</a> class caters for this, for example).</p>

<p>If you're handling a TopicAction or TopicTAction that's already defined in the adv3Lite library, you don't have to worry about any of this too much, since all these library-defined TopicActions and TopicTActions are designed to be handled by TopicEntry objects, so all you need to do is to define the appropriate TopicDatabase and the TopicEntries within it (as in the <a href="topicentry.htm">Consultables</a> and <a href="thought.htm">Thoughts</a> above, and in the conversational commands discussed later on in this manual).</p>

<br>

<a name="defining"></a><h2>Defining New TopicActions and TopicTActions</h2>

<p>It's hard to think of any useful examples of TopicActions and TopicTActions that aren't already defined in the library, but if, say, you wanted to define a WorryAbout command that did something different from ThinkAbout you'd start by defining the VerbRule thus:</p>

 <p><div class="code"><pre>
VerbRule(WorryAbout)
    ('worry' | 'fret') 'about' topicDobj
    : VerbProduction
    action = WorryAbout
    verbPhrase = 'worry/worrying (about what)'
    missingQ = 'what do you want to worry about'
;
</pre></div>

<p>You'd probably then handle worries in much the same way as the library handles Thoughts:</p>

<p><div class="code"><pre>
DefineTopicAction(WorryAbout)
    execAction(cmd)
    {
       worryManager.handleTopic(cmd.dobj.topicList);
    }
;


worryManager: PreinitObject, TopicDatabase
    execute()
    {        
        forEachInstance(Worry, new function(t) {
            if(t.location == self)
                addTopic(t);
        });
    }   
    
    handleTopic(top)
    {
        local match = getBestMatch(worryList, top);
        if(match == nil)
            say(noWorryMsg);
        else
            match.topicResponse();
    }
    
    worryList = []
    
    noWorryMsg = 'You\'re really not at all worried about that right now. '
;


<span class="comment">/* 
 *   A kind of TopicEntry that responds to a WORRY ABOUT command when located in
 *   the worryManager object. These can be defined just like any other topic
 *   entry objects, and work in just the same way as ConsultTopics.
 */</span>
class Worry: TopicEntry
    includeInList = [&amp;worryList]
;

class DefaultWorry: Worry
    matchTopic(top)
    {
        return matchScore + scoreBoost;
    }
    
    matchScore = 1
;
</pre></div>



<p>Define a TopicTAction requires much the same steps as definind a TopicAction, except that the VerbRule needs two object slots, one of them being either topicDobj or topicIobj (depening on its grammatical role; remember that in either case the TopicTAction will treat the physical object involved as actual direct object). For example, to define a BotherAbout command we might define:</p>

 <p><div class="code"><pre>
VerbRule(BotherAbout)
    ('bother' | 'worry' | 'vex') singleDobj 'about' topicIobj
    : VerbProduction
    action = BotherAbout
    verbPhrase = 'bother/bothering (whom) (about what)'
    missingQ = 'whom do you want to bother; what do you want to bother it about'
    dobjReply = singleNoun
;  
  
DefineTopicTAction(BotherAbout)
;
</pre></div>
 
<p>The next step would be to define default handling for this on Thing, to the effect that an inanimate object can't be bothered:</p>

 <p><div class="code"><pre>
modify Thing
  dobjFor(BotherAbout)
  {
      preCond = [objAudible]
      verify() { illogical(cannotBeBotheredMsg); }
  }
  
  cannotBeBotheredMsg = '{The subj dobj} {can\'t} be bothered. '
;</pre></div>

<p>You'd next need to define some handling on the actor class analogous to the way it handles conversational topics like AskTopics, but that can be left as an exercise for the interested reader.</p>

<h2>How the Library Matches ResolvedTopics to Topic Entries</h2>

<p>You may be wondering how the library uses the topicList property of a ResolvedTopic (which, you may recall, ends up occupying either the dobj or the iobj slot of the current Command object) when matching a topic-involving command (such as LOOK UP SELVAGEE IN DICTIONARY) to a database of TopicEntries. The answer is that the various handleTopic routines the library uses try every Topic in the ResolvedTopic's topicList against every available TopicEntry and uses the one that gives the best match (i.e., the one that returns the highest matchScore). If there's a tie, the library simply chooses one at random (or rather, the first one it came across that had the highest matchScore, but you'd be unwise to rely on this precise behaviour in your own game code). Amongst other things, this behaviour ensures that the player is never asked to disambiguate a topic, but it does put the onus on game authors to take a little bit of care in defining TopicEntries. It's fair enough if the player types ASK AUNT MAUDE ABOUT BALL expecting a reply about the blue beach ball and instead gets a reply about last month's gala ball &mdash; after all if the player character knows about both topics the player has to recognize that the command was ambiguous &mdash; but it should be made absolutely clear to the player precisely what question Aunt Maude is answering under such circumstances. Also, if it's in fact more important for the player to learn Aunt Maude's views on the gala ball than on the blue beach ball, but she has Topic Entries for both, it's probably a good idea to define the gala ball TopicEntry with a higher matchScore so that it's the one that ends up getting chosen in cases of ambiguity.</p>
