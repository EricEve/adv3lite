<h1>Instructions</h1>

<p>The Instructions module (instruct.t) is located under the English directory, since it is specific to the English-language version of the library. Its function is to provide players of your game with a set of general instructions for playing interactive fiction, which may be read in response to an INTRUCTIONS command (to which you'll probably want to call your players' attention in your introductory text or via your ABOUT text).</p>

<p>If you have the menu modules included in your game (menusys.t and menucon.t or menuweb.t), you'll probably want the instructions to be shown in menu form rather than as a continuous block of text. To to this you need to define <a name="ins_menu_idx">INSTRUCTIONS_MENU</a>, either by adding -D INSTRUCTIONS_MENU as a command line option if you use t3Make from the command line, or else by adding INSTRUCTIONS_MENU to the list of symbols to #define in Worbench. To to this in Workbench select Build -&gt; Settings from the menu, then select "Defines" under the "Compiler" section on the left-hand side of the dialog box, then click Add, type INSTRUCTIONS_MENU in the "Macro Name" box, leave "Expansion" blank and click OK, then click OK again. You'll probably then need to do a full recompile for debugging to force a recompile of instruct.t.</p>

<p>The Instructions module makes some attempt to be context-sensitive about the instructions it provides; for example it won't describe the GO TO command if the pathfind module isn't present, and it won't talk about SpecialTopics if none have been defined in your game. In addition, you can override a number of properties of the Instructions object to customize what is shown to the player:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>allRequiredVerbsDisclosed</strong>: This property tells us how complete the verb list is.  By default,
     we'll assume that the instructions fail to disclose every required
     verb in the game, because the generic set we use here doesn't even
     try to anticipate the special verbs that most games include.  If
     you provide your own list of game-specific verbs, and your custom
     list (taken together with the generic list) discloses every verb
     required to complete the game, you should set this property to
     true; if you set this to true, the instructions will assure the
     player that they will not need to think of any verbs besides the
     ones listed in the instructions.  Authors are strongly encouraged
     to disclose a list of verbs that is sufficient by itself to
     complete the game, and to set this property to true once they've
     done so.</li>
     
<li><a name="custverbs"></a><strong>customVerbs</strong>: 
     A list of custom verbs.  Each game should set this to a list of
     single-quoted strings; each string gives an example of a verb to
     display in the list of sample verbs.  Something like this:
     customVerbs = ['brush my teeth', 'pick the lock'] 
     </li>

<li><strong>conversationVerbs</strong>: Verbs relating specifically to character interaction.  This is in
     the same format as customVerbs, and has essentially the same
     purpose; however, we call these out separately to allow each game
     not only to supplement the default list we provide but to replace
     our default list.  This is desirable for conversation-related
     commands in particular because some games will not use the
     ASK/TELL conversation system at all and will thus want to remove
     any mention of the standard set of verbs.</li>
     
<li><strong>conversationAbbr</strong>: A double quoted string explaining the abbreviations that can
    be used for conversation verbs, e.g. (as defined by default) "\n\tASK ABOUT (topic) can be abbreviated
                        to A (topic) \n\tTELL ABOUT (topic) can be entered as T (topic)"</li>
                        
<li><strong>truncationLength</strong>:  Truncation length. If the game's parser allows words to be
     abbreviated to some minimum number of letters, this should
     indicate the minimum length.  The English parser uses a truncation
     length of 8 letters by default.
        
     Set this to nil if the game doesn't allow truncation at all.</li>

<li><a name="cruelty"></a></a><strong>crueltyLevel</strong>: This property should be set on a game-by-game basis to indicate
     the "cruelty level" of the game, which is a rough estimation of
     how likely it is that the player will encounter an unwinnable
     position in the game.<ul>
     <li>   
     Level 0 is "kind," which means that the player character can
     never be killed, and it's impossible to make the game unwinnable.
     When this setting is used, the instructions will reassure the
     player that saving is necessary only to suspend the session.
     <li> 
     Level 1 is "standard," which means that the player character can
     be killed, and/or that unwinnable positions are possible, but
     that there are no especially bad unwinnable situations.  When
     this setting is selected, we'll warn the player that they should
     save every so often.
     <li> 
     (An "especially bad" situation is one in which the game becomes
     unwinnable at some point, but this won't become apparent to the
     player until much later.  For example, suppose the first scene
     takes place in a location that can never be reached again after
     the first scene, and suppose that there's some object you can
     obtain in this scene.  This object will be required in the very
     last scene to win the game; if you don't have the object, you
     can't win.  This is an "especially bad" unwinnable situation: if
     you leave the first scene without getting the necessary object,
     the game is unwinnable from that point forward.  In order to win,
     you have to go back and play almost the whole game over again.
     Saved positions are almost useless in a case like this, since
     most of the saved positions will be after the fatal mistake; no
     matter how often you saved, you'll still have to go back and do
     everything over again from near the beginning.)
     <li> 
     Level 2 is "cruel," which means that the game can become
     unwinnable in especially bad ways, as described above.  If this
     level is selected, we'll warn the player more sternly to save
     frequently.
     <li> 
     We set this to 1 ("standard") by default, because even games that
     aren't intentionally designed to be cruel often have subtle
     situations where the game becomes unwinnable, because of things
     like the irreversible loss of an object, or an unrepeatable event
     sequence; it almost always takes extra design work to ensure that
     a game is always winnable.</ul></li>     
</ul>
