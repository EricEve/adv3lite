name: Adv3liter
desc: Create a game based on the Adv3Liter library, using the 
  core modules plus a selection of the most commonly needed optional
  ones. This is probably most useful for implementing a game involving
  a lone protagonist interacting with their physical environment
  but without any significant NPCs.
