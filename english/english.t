     *   and on dynamically constructing a new Mentionable, to initialize up the
     *   object's vocabulary for use by the parser.
     *
     *   The vocab string is designed to make it as quick and easy as possible
     *   to define an object's name and vocabulary.  To the extent possible, we
     *   derive the vocabulary from the name, so for many objects the whole
     *   definition will just look like the object name. However, we also make
     *   it possible to define as much extra vocabulary beyond the name as
     *   needed, and to control the way the words making up the name are handled
     *   in terms of their parts of speech.
     *
     *   The 'vocab' string has this overall syntax:
     *
     *.    vocab = 'article short name; adjectives; nouns; pronouns'
     *
     *   You don't have to include all of the parts; you can simply stop when
     *   you're done, so it's valid, for example, to just write the 'short name'
     *   part.  It's also fine to include an empty part: if you have extra nouns
     *   to list, but no adjectives, you can say 'short name;;nouns'.
     *
     *   The 'article' is optional.  This can be one of 'a', 'an', 'some', or
     *   '()'.  If it's 'a' or 'an', and this differs from what we'd
     *   automatically generate based on the first word of the short name, we
     *   automatically enter the first word into the list of special cases for
     *   a/an words.  If it's 'some', we automatically set massNoun=true for the
     *   object.  If it's '-', we set qualified=true ('()' means that the name
     *   doesn't take an article at all).
     *
     *   Note that if you want to use 'a', 'an', 'some', or '()' as the first
     *   word of the actual short name, you simply need to add the desired
     *   article in front of it: 'an a tile from a scrabble set'.
     *
     *   The short name gives name that we display whenever the parser needs to
     *   show the object in a list, an announcement, etc.
     *
     *   If the short name consists entirely of capitalized words (that is, if
     *   every word starts with a capital letter), and the 'proper' property
     *   isn't explicitly set for this object, we'll set 'proper' to true to
     *   indicate that this is a proper name.
     *
     *   We also try to infer the object's vocabulary words from the short name.
     *   We first break off any prepositional phrases, if we see the
     *   prepositions 'to', 'of', 'from', 'with', or 'for'.  We then assume that
     *   the FIRST phrase is of the form 'adj adj adj... noun' - that is, zero
     *   or more adjectives followed by a noun; and that the SECOND and
     *   subsequent phrases are entirely adjectives.  You can override the
     *   part-of-speech inference by putting the actual part of speech
     *   immediately after a word (with no spaces) in square brackets: 'John[n]
     *   Smith' overrides the assumption that 'John' is an adjective.  Use [n]
     *   to make a word a noun, [adj] to make it an adjective, [prep] to make it
     *   a preposition, and [pl] to make it a plural. You can also add [weak] to
     *   make it a weak token (one on which the object won't be matched alone),
     *   or equivalently, enclose the word in parentheses. These annotations
     *   are stripped out of the name when it's displayed.
     *
     *   We consider ALL of the words in the short name's second and subsequent
     *   phrases (the prepositional phrases) to be adjectives, except for the
     *   preposition words themselves, which we consider to be prepositions.
     *   This is because these phrases all effectively qualify the main phrase,
     *   so we don't consider them as "important" to the object's name.  This
     *   helps the parser be smarter about disambiguation, without bothering the
     *   user with clarifying questions all the time.  When the player types
     *   "garage", we'll match the "key to the garage" object as well as the
     *   "garage" object, but if both objects are present, we'll know to choose
     *   the garage over the key because the noun usage is a better match to
     *   what the user typed.
     *
     *   We automatically ignore articles (a, an, the, and some) as vocabulary
     *   words when they immediately follow prepositions in the short name.  For
     *   example, in 'key to the garage', we omit 'the' as a vocabulary word for
     *   the object because it immediately follows 'to'.  We also omit 'to',
     *   since we don't enter the prepositions as vocabulary.  We do the
     *   complementary work on parsing, by ignoring these words when we see them
     *   in the command input in the proper positions.  These words are really
     *   structural parts of the grammar rather than parts of the object names,
     *   so the parser can do a better job of recognizing noun phrases by
     *   considering the grammatical functions of these words.
     *
     *   For many (if not most) objects, the short name won't be enough to state
     *   all of the vocabulary words you want to recognize for the object in
     *   command input.  Trying to cram every possible vocabulary word into the
     *   short name would usually make for an unwieldy display name.
     *   Fortunately, it's easy to add input vocabulary words that aren't
     *   displayed in the name.  Just add a semicolon, then the adjectives, then
     *   another semicolon, then the nouns.
     *
     *   Note that there's no section for adding extra prepositions, but you can
     *   still add them.  Put the prepositions in the adjective list, and
     *   explicitly annotate each one as a preposition by adding "[prep]" at the
     *   end, as in "to[prep]".
     *
     *   Next, there's the matter of plurals.  For each noun, we'll try to
     *   automatically infer a plural according to the spelling pattern. We also
     *   have a table of common irregular plurals that we'll apply. For
     *   irregular words that aren't in the table, you can override the
     *   spelling-based plural by putting the real plural in braces
     *   immediately after the noun, with no spaces.  Start with a hyphen to
     *   specify a suffix; otherwise just write the entire plural word. For
     *   example, you could write 'man{men}' or 'child{-ren}' (although these
     *   particular irregular plurals are already in our special-case list, so
     *   the custom plurals aren't actually needed in these cases).  You can use
     *   plural annotations in the short name as well as the extra noun list;
     *   they'll be removed from the short name when it's displayed.  We don't
     *   try to generate a plural for a proper noun (a noun that starts with a
     *   capital letter), but you can provide explicit plurals.
     *
     *   For words longer than the truncation length in the string comparator,
     *   you can set the word to match exactly by adding '=' as the last
     *   character.  This also requires exact character matching, rather than
     *   allowing accented character approximations (e.g., matching 'a' in the
     *   input to 'a-umlaut' in the dictionary).
     *
     *   We automatically assume that plurals should be matched without
     *   truncation.  This is because English plurals are usually formed with
     *   suffixes; if the user wants to enter a plural, they'll have to type the
     *   whole word anyway, because that's the only way you make it all the way
     *   to the suffix.  You can override this assumption for a given plural by
     *   adding '~' at the end of the plural.  This explicitly allows truncated
     *   and character approximation matches.
     *
     *   Finally, the 'pronouns' section gives a list of the pronouns that this
     *   word can match.  You can include 'it', 'him', 'her', and 'them' in this
     *   section.  We'll automatically set the isIt, isHim, isHer, and plural
     *   properties to true when we see the corresponding pronouns.
