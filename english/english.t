     *   initialize up the object's vocabulary for use by the parser.
     *   
     *   The vocab string is designed to make it as quick and easy as
     *   possible to define an object's name and vocabulary.  To the extent
     *   possible, we derive the vocabulary from the name, so for many
     *   objects the whole definition will just look like the object name.
     *   However, we also make it possible to define as much extra
     *   vocabulary beyond the name as needed, and to control the way the
     *   words making up the name are handled in terms of their parts of
     *   speech.
     *   
     *   The 'vocab' string has this overall syntax:
     *   
     *.    vocab = 'article short name; adjectives; nouns; pronouns'
     *   
     *   You don't have to include all of the parts; you can simply stop
     *   when you're done, so it's valid, for example, to just write the
     *   'short name' part.  It's also fine to include an empty part: if
     *   you have extra nouns to list, but no adjectives, you can say
     *   'short name;;nouns'.
     *   
     *   The 'article' is optional.  This can be one of 'a', 'an', 'some',
     *   or '()'.  If it's 'a' or 'an', and this differs from what we'd
     *   automatically generate based on the first word of the short name,
     *   we automatically enter the first word into the list of special
     *   cases for a/an words.  If it's 'some', we automatically set
     *   massNoun=true for the object.  If it's '-', we set qualified=true
     *   ('()' means that the name doesn't take an article at all).
     *   
     *   Note that if you want to use 'a', 'an', 'some', or '()' as the
     *   first word of the actual short name, you simply need to add the
     *   desired article in front of it: 'an a tile from a scrabble set'.
     *   
     *   The short name gives name that we display whenever the parser
     *   needs to show the object in a list, an announcement, etc.
     *   
     *   If the short name consists entirely of capitalized words (that is,
     *   if every word starts with a capital letter), and the 'proper'
     *   property isn't explicitly set for this object, we'll set 'proper'
     *   to true to indicate that this is a proper name.
     *   
     *   We also try to infer the object's vocabulary words from the short
     *   name.  We first break off any prepositional phrases, if we see the
     *   prepositions 'to', 'of', 'from', 'with', or 'for'.  We then assume
     *   that the FIRST phrase is of the form 'adj adj adj... noun' - that
     *   is, zero or more adjectives followed by a noun; and that the
     *   SECOND and subsequent phrases are entirely adjectives.  You can
     *   override the part-of-speech inference by putting the actual part
     *   of speech immediately after a word (with no spaces) in square
     *   brackets: 'John[n] Smith' overrides the assumption that 'John' is
     *   an adjective.  Use [n] to make a word a noun, [adj] to make it an
     *   adjective, [prep] to make it a preposition, and [pl] to make it a
     *   plural.  These annotations are stripped out of the name when it's
     *   displayed.
     *   
     *   We consider ALL of the words in the short name's second and
     *   subsequent phrases (the prepositional phrases) to be adjectives,
     *   except for the preposition words themselves, which we consider to
     *   be prepositions.  This is because these phrases all effectively
     *   qualify the main phrase, so we don't consider them as "important"
     *   to the object's name.  This helps the parser be smarter about
     *   disambiguation, without bothering the user with clarifying
     *   questions all the time.  When the player types "garage", we'll
     *   match the "key to the garage" object as well as the "garage"
     *   object, but if both objects are present, we'll know to choose the
     *   garage over the key because the noun usage is a better match to
     *   what the user typed.
     *   
     *   We automatically ignore articles (a, an, the, and some) as
     *   vocabulary words when they immediately follow prepositions in the
     *   short name.  For example, in 'key to the garage', we omit 'the' as
     *   a vocabulary word for the object because it immediately follows
     *   'to'.  We also omit 'to', since we don't enter the prepositions as
     *   vocabulary.  We do the complementary work on parsing, by ignoring
     *   these words when we see them in the command input in the proper
     *   positions.  These words are really structural parts of the grammar
     *   rather than parts of the object names, so the parser can do a
     *   better job of recognizing noun phrases by considering the
     *   grammatical functions of these words.
     *   
     *   For many (if not most) objects, the short name won't be enough to
     *   state all of the vocabulary words you want to recognize for the
     *   object in command input.  Trying to cram every possible vocabulary
     *   word into the short name would usually make for an unwieldy
     *   display name.  Fortunately, it's easy to add input vocabulary
     *   words that aren't displayed in the name.  Just add a semicolon,
     *   then the adjectives, then another semicolon, then the nouns.
     *   
     *   Note that there's no section for adding extra prepositions, but
     *   you can still add them.  Put the prepositions in the adjective
     *   list, and explicitly annotate each one as a preposition by adding
     *   "[prep]" at the end, as in "to[prep]".
     *   
     *   Next, there's the matter of plurals.  For each noun, we'll try to
     *   automatically infer a plural according to the spelling pattern.
     *   We also have a table of common irregular plurals that we'll apply.
     *   For irregular words that aren't in the table, you can override the
     *   spelling-based plural by putting the real plural in parentheses
     *   immediately after the noun, with no spaces.  Start with a hyphen
     *   to specify a suffix; otherwise just write the entire plural word.
     *   For example, you could write 'man(men)' or 'child(-ren)' (although
     *   these particular irregular plurals are already in our special-case
     *   list, so the custom plurals aren't actually needed in these
     *   cases).  You can use plural annotations in the short name as well
     *   as the extra noun list; they'll be removed from the short name
     *   when it's displayed.  We don't try to generate a plural for a
     *   proper noun (a noun that starts with a capital letter), but you
     *   can provide explicit plurals.
     *   
     *   For words longer than the truncation length in the string
     *   comparator, you can set the word to match exactly by adding '=' as
     *   the last character.  This also requires exact character matching,
     *   rather than allowing accented character approximations (e.g.,
     *   matching 'a' in the input to 'a-umlaut' in the dictionary).
     *   
     *   We automatically assume that plurals should be matched without
     *   truncation.  This is because English plurals are usually formed
     *   with suffixes; if the user wants to enter a plural, they'll have
     *   to type the whole word anyway, because that's the only way you
     *   make it all the way to the suffix.  You can override this
     *   assumption for a given plural by adding '~' at the end of the
     *   plural.  This explicitly allows truncated and character
     *   approximation matches.
     *   
     *   Finally, the 'pronouns' section gives a list of the pronouns that
     *   this word can match.  You can include 'it', 'him', 'her', and
     *   'them' in this section.  We'll automatically set the isIt, isHim,
     *   isHer, and plural properties to true when we see the corresponding
     *   pronouns.
