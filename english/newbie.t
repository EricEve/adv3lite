 *   NewbieGrammar.h extension for Inform 6, itself based on observation of 
 *   some of the non-standard things newcomers to IF tend to type. The idea 
 *   is to get the parser to recognize these commands, at least to the 
 *   extent of giving the player who issues them some help towards typing 
 *   more useful commands rather than giving a standard (and probably 
 *   unhelpful) parser error message
 *
 *   We also provide some helpful brief IF playing instructions for newbies, 
 *   a sample transcript they can view to get the general idea, and a 
 *   mechanism to check whether someone is entering an excessive number of 
 *   invalid commands (so that we can then offer more help).
