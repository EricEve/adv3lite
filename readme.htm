<h1>ADV3LITE VERSION 0.8</h1>

<p>Thank you for your interest in adv3Lite, an alternative library for use with the TADS 3 Interactive Fiction authoring system.</p>

<p>To learn about using adv3Lite in your own work you can consult the <a href="manual/index.htm">Library Manual</a> and/or the <a href="tutorial/index.htm">Tutorial</a>. The Library Manual is useful as a reference for users who have completed (or who are working through) the Tutorial, or as a starting point for users who are already familiar with a similar IF authoring system, such as the adv3 library that comes as standard with TADS 3.</p>

<p>The <a href="libref/index.html">Adv3Lite Library Reference Manual</a> meanwhile provides a complete reference to the classes, objects, methods, properties, functions, templates, macros, enums and messages defined in the library, all indexed and cross-referenced to the source code.</p>

<p>Existing users who have just downloaded this version of adv3Lite may wish to consult the <a href="manual/changelog.htm">Change Log</a>. New or potential users may wish to begin with a fuller description of <a href="tutorial/whatis.htm">what adv3Lite is</a>.</p>

<p>For information about the TADS 3 language, intrinsic classes and other system features, please consult the <a href="sysman.htm">TADS 3 System Manual</a>. (By default this link will take you to the on-line version of the TADS 3 documentation on www.tads.org; if you'd prefer to use your local copy of the System Manual you can do so by editing the file sysman.htm in this directory)</p>
